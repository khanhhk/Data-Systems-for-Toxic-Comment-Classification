"Hi RedRose and apologies for delay. Here is a draft of what I propose to present on the 'new section' pages.
The 6 volumes of Ultimate Allocations cover the 'reported' allocations of all British Railways: Steam  Diesel & Electric Locomotives on BR stock from 1950 - 1968 with additional information from 1948 where available. They are formatted in A4 comb bound volumes for ease of use. There are 3 main columns which are sub-divided with individual locomotive details including date when 'new' if appropriate. All 'reported' and published allocations and re-allocations combined with withdrawal dates where known are listed on either 'Weekly' - 'Monthly' - or 'Period Ending' dependant on regional variations at that time. A link to several testimonials and scanned images type of information provided can be found at www.ultimate-allocations.co.uk
Please advise if this information would be acceptable for presentation in the 'new section' you previously advised. I look forward to seeing your reply and thank you once again for your assistance in this matter.

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

 Unprotected 
I'm going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  

All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) 

They may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  

I don't think we can expect the words """"new anti-Semitism"""" to appear in every single report we reference. We've defined it, and we've linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:

It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the """"new anti-Semitism."""" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.

All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) 

My worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I'd just want to tidy that up.  

Livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) 

Slim, whose definition is this?   

All the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) 

I think you mean """"all the sources from one side of the argument put together"""".  It's been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   
Sorry, you'll have to look in the archives; they're either there or in the article. By """"all the sources,"""" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk)

Why did you delete the one source that we've been talking the most about? Why do you want to hide the truth from readers? The concepts of qi and meridians are very contentious, because they don't exist from a reductionist, disectionist, Western medical science point of view. 

Do you want to know what meridians are? Every type of tissue, muscle fiber, etc, is wrapped up and enclosed in fascia. Meridians are the spaces in between these fascia, you are never going to """"find"""" them by cutting bodies apart and looking at them in a microscope. They are the nothingness that provides function, as in verse 11 of the Tao Te Ching 
""""Thirty spokes converge
In the hub of a wheel;
But the use of the cart
Will depend on the part
On the hub that is void.

With a wall all around
A clay bowl is molded;
But the use of the bowl
Will depend on the part
Of the bowl that is void.

Cut out windows and doors
In the house as you build;
But the use of the house
Will depend on the space
In the walls that is void

So advantage is had
From whatever is there;
But usefulness arises
From what is not.""""

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

"""==Name==
I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?  
I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  
there is a street in KJ called Sakmer

also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg

The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.

I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  

It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  
I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. 

About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, """"satu"""" is derived from Latin """"fossatum"""" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin """"fossa""""). """"Cetate"""" is the Romanian word derived from """"civitas"""".  | Talk

You clearly aren't, so will never have the affinity for him that I do, my blood tie goes one step beyond your religious pride in him, which incidentally I DO RESPECT. I am not Hindu, correct.

There are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their """"ancestry"""" - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. The rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. They are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all Australian or Irish in origin.

 /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as .

 [ç] is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. [ç] is an allophone of /h/, but [ɰ] is not.
 Actually, [ɰ] is redundant since it is just a short [ɯ] (like [j] is a short [i] and [w] is a short [u]) — we could just use a non-syllabic diacritic.

 Signpost exit poll  
Dear Wikipedian, you recently voted in the ArbCom election.  Your username, along with around 155 other usernames of your fellow Wikipedians, was randomly selected from the 2000+ Wikipedians who voted this year, with the help of one of the election-commissioners.  If you are willing, could you please participate (at your option either on-wiki via userspace or off-wiki via email) in an exit poll, and answer some questions about how you decided amongst the ArbCom candidates?

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

About the things I edit, they are of the most relevant kind to what is sayed ont this site.
All pseudo subbjects are all lies as the Bogdanovs have alredy answered all those points in different places of the web, inclusiv wiki, at different times, for the past 2 years.
For 13 days ago there was absolutely nothing more to discuss about, and seeing that, YBM used his ususal tactic who is to do as if they din't have answered the questions at hand, and that way, confuse the other users and make them believe that it was the case, as he has always done since 2003.
Someone has to stand up and say it, someone has to put an end to this circus, and I choose to do so.
I do not have followed the story from the beginning and do not know the Bogdanov but through this affair, that I begin to interest myself with since the beginning og august.
Two things became clear for me as I scanned all the web on the subjects: YBM was the person doing all the staging, and YBM didn't knew what he was talking about. I also found out that no matter how many times and in how many languages and by how many specialists the answers were given to him, he will keep asking and accusing peoples, and agress them personnally and accuse them of not being edicated in that field or critisized their university or making threat at contacting their chiefs, and even insult them to push them away from the discussion platform, as this kind of people represented a real threat to his status.
And of course, especially when we are talking of the scientific platform like in fr. physic or scent physic, those people, phd or professor at university were not used at being roll around with nor being talking to that way and even less at being insulted and confronted with non argumentativ methods.
So they left and never show up again, leeving all free room that YBM could ever wish for to pursue his goal.
But what was this goal exactly?
It wasn't the truth as he kept lying and had been given all answers, and was often denying to have done certain things who were appearing very often.
He was repeating himself and soon I saw a pattern emerging, from all his apparitions on the web, with falsh accusations, lies, home made stories, fantasyfull evidences, links to web sites from his own making, agression, personal attacs, insults.
His goal was not at all to discuss science but to manipulate others and he managed to do so very well as he was allowed to fool so many for such a long time. T>wo years is a very long time for a little subject as this one.
Then I was contacted by people who had been confronted to him, prior to this case, and had been subject to the same attacks and methods on the web.
I stude it, and saw worse than I could ever imagined. It was all planed from the beginning and a part of an ideologie with filosofical pretenses on how one could manipulate other people meaning by creating a situation on line.
It is what they call Post situationism, and wich is issued of Voyer. In the previous case against a teacher that he knew from school and a women writer (on cooking books!) he had just met Voyer but been found of him for a longer time, by the beginning of Bogdanovs affair he had been introduce inside the rangs of Voyer and Co, and as the affair progressed assured himself a high status in this """"confrerie"""".
That is the reason why this article I come with is of such importance. It reveal what was behind all along, what motivated the principal actors of this mascarade, and show all that they have been manipulated from the beginning and still are.
There is no Bogdanov affair, it is an illusion, a part from a group of ideologs making a thinking experiment and giving life to it by means of the internet.
Brillant! Unless there was casualties.
And there is.
Plenty of, and more than the Bogdanovs private sphere and their career.
I was really aroused from the beginning when I realised what YBM was about but even more when I saw what it all was really about, I was shocked by how unpropper and unethical it all was, and what a big unjustice it was to all who were involved in it, and this also include people who have followed and defended the apparent vews of YBM not kn",0
"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

What follows is a discussion with DonaldRichardSands transferred from my user talk page   

Dear DonaldRichardSands,

The link for the revised article is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)/new 
Thanks for taking a look. From what you wrote above, I understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. I would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. All best  
I think it would be more accurate to say, the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. However, and this is what will take the time, the old version does have merits which should not be lost. There is an energy among some people to show that Berezovsky is a mafia-like boss. When I told a friend about Berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how I would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article, my friend expressed shock and dismay that I would risk my life so. The article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. This balance is what takes the time. I would enjoy helping. Your energy for the article is obvious. If we could get an editor who wants to portray Berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration, the article could strengthen quickly. In the article I am working on presently, one other editor is active and he is very critical. But, he and I have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. Similar cooperation could happen for the Berezovsky article. Rely on Secondary Sources. Insist on a conservative, scholarly examination of all aspect of Berezovsky's life. And, yes, I still want to email him, ask him for a picture, and perhaps go for coffee. )      
Dear DonaldRichardSands, thank you for your input. Of course, Mr. Berezovsky is a highly controversial person, and I think, all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. But he is a major figure, who influenced Russian political history over two decades, and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the whole Russia block on Wikipedia. With respect, the belief of """"some people"""" that Berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion, which is not supported by facts. If an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous, it has no place on Wikipedia, regardless of how many people may hold it. Otherwise we should change the rules and make Wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. Under current rules, we should work with well sourced facts. The facts in this matter are as follows. (1) That particular opinion has originated from a single source (Mr. Klebnikov), whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. (2) The publication (Forbes), which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. (3) Dozens of profiles of Mr. Berezovsky in major world newspapers, which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism - including serious Russian sources - do not repeat these allegations. I believe that Wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. The revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced, which was then discredited. Of course, if anyone can quote another reputable source, which supports this opinion with evidence, it should be mentioned. Since I am going on vacation, I have put the revised text on the main page, and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via History tag), amend, challenge and comment - as long as it is done by the rules. The last thing I want is another edit war. On the other hand, seeking consensus is just one of Wikipedia rules. Avoiding pushing opinions, and removing unsourced slander is another.  """,0

More on guarnello
""""GUARNELLO (M/F). Both a kind of linen or cotton textile, and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."""" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted here

The coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.
page 80

This site says:
A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's """"Three graces"""" wears in his """"Primavera"""", but it can also be seen in his portrait of """"Smeralda Brandini"""" in London.

That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.

The fabric is also translated as """"fustian"""" which would seem to be the coarser variety.

And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) says
Mona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth. The filmy robe was called a guarnello.

 Re: History merges 

The instructions are all laid out at Wikipedia:How to fix cut-and-paste moves. As I found out quickly, when you try to move an article from Title A to Title B and Title B already exists, the software will automatically delete the edits of Title B for you when you move the article. Try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in MediaWiki. Also, it's a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldn't be reverted. Once I was history merging Melbourne, and a well-meaning editor tried to move it back while I was working on the history merge, which resulted in Melbourne disappearing from Wikipedia for a few minutes. Maybe I'll try the same thing at Auckland one day -). Hope this helps some. ''''''87 """,0

"Improvement needed 

While I've declined speedy deletion, I see two major areas that require improvement in the article.
Notability: While there are some assertions of significance, such as winning Seedcamp 2008, it's not entirely clear how major that competition is. Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.
Reliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.

Reviewing your sources.... """"MSM in Africa"""" does not contain the string """"trans"""" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that """"TG is typically considered alongside"""".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: """"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."""" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as """"MSM"""" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as """"MSTGW"""" and not """"MSM"""" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: """"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as """"balls."""" These social networks include """"houses"""" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000). All four also were commercial sex workers.""""  This is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.
My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

Also, your commentary - """"It is generally considered that UNMIK failed in all of these tasks."""" - is both POV and far too vague. Who considers this to be the case? How has UNMIK failed? Where and when? You don't answer these questions. There's certainly room for an overview of UNMIK's activities and success (or lack of it). If you want to provide some detail, go for it, but your one-liner provides neither  detail nor a NPOV.   00:10, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)""",0

"Mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. I do not know anything about this topic, but looking at the Criticism section of the current article, it appears to all be reflective of specific time-periods and therefore belongs in the History section. A dedicated Criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. Though you could also look at it the other way, that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.

As for the draft, I see there are some nice plugs for Moodys, that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. Well... I wrote the article on History of public relations and it mentions some PR agencies that played a role in its history, so this is not unprecedented. However, I am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. 

I think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention, but I would suggest an editor do some light research independently, trim, copyedit and re-write it and mix it with the current Criticisms section into a more balanced History.  (Talk)",0

In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.  No, you were not successful.  In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.  You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.  You must also admit that you were stalking me on WP:  Tell them what mechanism you used, so they know what you did.  (The fact you used that mechanism will show them how illegitimate your motives were.)
The reality is (remember reality?) that according to the remnants of their archived webpage, EURO did not argue for """"white supremacy"""", """"white separatism"""", """"white nationalism"""", or any other """"ism"""" I can imagine would be relevant.  The problem is, Political Correctness rears its ugly head, yet again, and persons who display less-than-sufficient obeisance to the fascistic-left will be shut off, shut down, and maybe even shut away.

Harrassment, I did not do.  He posted a question or whatever and I replyed, I was never rude, I never cussed, I never said anything rude to him or about him (if you want to count """"are you 5?"""" in that, OK, I admit that one).  

The edit warring...I was removing posts on the KDKA-TV page that did not belong.  Newscasts on WPCW, whether produced by KDKA or not, do not belong on the KDKA page.  I tried telling User:Kd lvr this, he didn't continued to post.  He was putting information that I couldn't confirm.  Such as former KDKA anchor Jennifer Antkowiak is now """"working with Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking Program"""".  I looked this site up and could find no mention of Ms. Antkowiak.  I did a Google search, same thing.  This is inaccurate and unconfirmed (if it is true) information.

The assuming bad faith, I had backed off on when it was found that User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr were not one in the same.  I thought they were, I didn't agree with it, but I had to accept that.  When User:Kdkatpir2 was blocked for sockpuppetry, then I knew than that it was as confirmed as it could be that User:Kd lvr was up to no good.  Had User:Kdkatpir2 not been blocked, I would not have done anything and would have gone back to updating pages like I have done.

I make it a point not to be rude to users here (there are other users for that), I make it a point to pass problems off to an admin so I don't get in trouble and cause I don't want to deal with it.  I was reverting posts on the KDKA page cause I thought it was the best thing to do at the time and prior to being blocked, I was actually updatign the KDKA page, so that the back and forth that User:Kd lvr and I were doing (which was annoying the hell outta me) would come to an end (and also make the page easier to read as well).

If I was only here to berate people day in and day out, I would have been blocked long ago.  I have been blocked only once before for a 24 hour 3RR violation, which I admit I did and I took something too far.  That was my fault that time, but I did nothing wrong here.  I was doing what I thought was right, reverting information that was incorrect and inaccurate and attempting to stop a user (who was ultimately found to be a sockpuppet by an admin) before harm was done by his behaviour.

If I seemed like I was being rude or I was breaking a rule, then I apologize.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean for my actions to come off in that light.  If my actions seemed wrong, I apologize.  I didn't mean for them to and I had no and have no ill-will toward User:Kdkatpir2 and User:Kd lvr.  If I have broken a rule, then again, I apologize, that was not my intention.

I, again, ask that my block be lifted as I did not mean for my actions to be taken in the way that they were and I was not trying to break any rules with my actions.  I, again, apologize. -  (VT) """,0

I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o )

These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making """"untrue"""" statements regarding his efforts.

Hi Codman. We have been through this before. Making highly emotive and subjective remarks in article is not appropriate for wikipedia.

I don't disagree with any of the points you are making but I will continue to tone down emotive remarks and remove opinions as they have no place here.

If you have facts then cite them. Commenting on research then saying 'therefore we must' is not encylopedic, it is your (probably correct) opinion. Saying something is criminally inadequate is rubbish as otherwise where are the legal proceedings?

I could also bring sources like uwarzamrze.pl, wpolityce.pl, wprost.pl, onet.pl and many others. But niezalezna.pl seems to provide the most of information on that investigation, the most detailed. You can always say they are political, right-wing, etc., and you can always call every investigation of any crime a “political game” because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it… But there is an interesting thing: If the Law and Justice party and all the “right-wing extremists” are pushing a fake-theory of an assassination, then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it? What do they have to hide? Why the Law and Justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident? 
What you are trying to defend here is a theory of a ghost-plane flying under the ground, smashed by one of the armored birches that grow only in Russia… And you don’t say it’s a fringe, conspiracy theory, it’s an official, true version! Just because the terrorists ruling in Russia (responsible for many other political murders – will you deny that?) said so, because they led an investigation on it and the Polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them (what else should they do?). And the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a “fringe theory” that has to be removed...  Also one thing I have to add here: do you know anything about the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008 and the role of L. Kaczynski there? Do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders (Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia), went to Tbilisi and forced Russian army to stop the attack on Georgia? See:  Do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there, in Georgia? See: . Do you know that the Katyn_massacre was also a revenge? 
However, after all, I’m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions, that about the fuel tanks. (then the official reports must be lies, too.) As I know, the fuel has to be mixed with air/oxygen in some proportion to explode, otherwise, with a surface-contact with air, it fires slowly. However, It is all to be investigate by an international commission. And, about the balance in the article, the only reliable theory is about 5% of contents and you say it’s too much...",0

 describes your actions as “’’’’’ rootless accusations of """"vandalism"""" in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article """"police state"""" don't even pass the straight face test.’’’’’”

 describes you as “’’’’’ the worst editor I have EVER encountered on wikipedia’’’’’” while encouraging you to “’’’’’ Please stop this childish behavior.’’’’’”.

 had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal * has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page. I then placed a warning on  talk page, which he promptly removed. He continues to remove the warnings.  has requested sources for the addition, at least five have been provided, yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war.     is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry.   

It seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the Police state article without your viewpoint. This is against WP:NPOV policy. Please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken.""",0

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

I wrote everything I wrote from the perspective I would think the article would eventually have anyway.  So you know exactly how I would think it should be presented.  There are only a few tweaks I'd make different, like calling it a scientific field to begin with, and possibly saying directly which types of psi scientists in the field think are real.

In fact, rather than wait, here's my complaint:

To whom it may concern, 
 
Hi.  My name's Jim Heller and I'm currently and for some time now caught up in a series of edit wars with Jossi Fresco.  The background is this.  I am a former follower of Prem Rawat, a/k/a Maharaji, a person I believe is a nefarious cult leader.  Fresco, on the other hand, is a current follower and, needless to say, of a different mind altogether.
 
For some years now, ever since the advent of the internet, Rawat and his followers have engaged in a long-standing campaign to whitewash Rawat's past and somehow protect him from the harsh light of history.  The latest flashpoint arose just today when I tried to edit a Wikipedia article of another of Rawat's current followers, a religious studies professor in fact, Ron Geaves (who, by the way, just shot to flashpan infamy as the English academic who opined that the July 7th bombers were """"demonstrators"""", not """"terrorists"""".  
 
Please excuse the fact that, to explain the problem in any meaningful way, I have to flesh out the context somewhat.  My edit concerned an academic (not Wikipedia) article Geaves had written where, discussing a program Rawat held in 1973, he wrote that:
In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

(My emphasis here and below)

In fact, a widely-disseminated invitation to that same 1973 program, Maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the """"millenial expectations"""" but fanned the flames substantially.  Thus, he declared the program the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""" and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:

A LETTER FROM GURU MAHARAJ JI 

Bonn, Germany 

September 31, 1973 

Dear premies, 

First of all, I would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. Because we have realized this beautiful Knowledge which is of great bliss to us all, it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. For it is something they really need. 

In the world there is suffering, hatred and dissatisfaction. That fact does not need proof. It is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. No one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. The world is looking for the Perfect Master to come and reveal the Perfect Knowledge of God. There is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the Perfect Masters coem to reveal this Knowledge to people. We can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace, for peace lies inside not outside in materialism. 

As you all know Millenium '73 is being prepared for now. This festival has been organized by Divine Light Mission each year since 1967, in the memory of the late Satgurudev Shri Hans Ji Maharaji on His birthday. This year the most Holy and significant event in human history will take place in America. 

I think that Millenium '73 is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner. 

To do this I really need your help. I really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically, financially and all other ways to make Millenium '73 come off. This is a festival not for you or me. It is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe. 

I hereby invite you to this Divine Festival of Peace, Millenium '73 and request all premies to help me financially, physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of Truth. 

Isn't it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this Earth? 

Blessings to you all, 

[Sant Ji Maharaj] 

 
It is clear, when you contrast Geaves' claim with the documentary evidence, that Geaves, bless his heart, is playing the role of the typical cult apologist, lying about his leader and blaming the followers, the press, anyone at all, for the inexcusable, laughable excesses of the cult.  What's particularly worrying about Geaves, I'm sure you can appreciate, is that, as a religious studies professor, he's imbued with a certain authority that",0

If I really had my way, I would reorganize this page (and every other Survivor page) to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables, and then a block with each episode detail: in the case of Survivor, you'd have your episode summary, exile reasoning, and voted out reasoning all in the same block.  The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 """"Wow, this is Survivor"""" (John)"""": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).  I think the latter would satisfy the gut feeling that they should be on there without affecting too much of the page.  06:19""",0

Another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to Rick Warren and Saddleback Church

Hi Steve. I don't mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation, but you might say that duty calls.

 The contributions list for CarverM indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with Saddleback Church, including Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life (Warren's book), The Purpose Driven Church (also a book by Warren), Doug Fields (a pastor at Saddleback), and Richard Abanes (a lay minister and former staffer at Saddleback).

 There is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the Saddleback Church page in CarverM's user space, here. It is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldn't qualify as an actual article. Why is it there?

 I'll note that the username CarverM bears a resemblance to the name Mark Carver. Carver was at one time (2006) described as """"a top aide to mega-church pastor and best selling author Rick Warren."""" Throwing """"Mark Carver"""" and """"Rick Warren"""" into Google yields 290 hits that I'll hesitate to characterize, but there are strong indications that CarverM is potentially not just another editor, and may be tightly connected with Warren.

"removal of a repeated inserted section that lacks sources etc.
Some editors put again and again the following passage in the section on the overview of the dispute:
 The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words. The representative said that he would look into all the evidences of human rights abuse within the Tibetan community in India and agreed that they were wrong.[8]

It could be suggested as an item for In The News. But looking at the On This Day section, I tend to agree that it's probably more notable than the arrest of Jeffrey Dahmer, which although important in the US, was surely less significant in terms of a particular day.   

On what basis?

See below.  — 

Oh, I thought the accusations of """"jumping to conclusions and blaming others"""" were meant for me. It was on the basis that it's in the (real) news, that's all. So much for trying to open a dialogue with an anon ip. Gosh, I must be stupid.   

No, I indented that reply directly below the original poster's message, not yours.  I replied to you above, with a different indentation level and separate signature.

ITN focuses on major events when they occur, not on subsequent remembrances (excepting rare instances in which they're extremely noteworthy in and of themselves).  — 

The 2011 Norway attacks were added to the 22 July queue and probably will appear on the main page next year.  As noted at Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/July 22, the section's primary maintainer generally avoids listing one-year-old events.
If you disagree with this practice (or wish to suggest any item), you're welcome to participate in the selection process by posting on the relevant dates' talk pages.  In fact, you could have added the item to the active list yourself before the page was automatically protected yesterday.
But I suppose it's easier to jump to conclusions and blame others than it is to collaborate.  — 

 I don't """"do"""" collaboration, even if I did, marking the anniversary of one of the worst terror attacks in European history should not be something that requires """"collaboration"""". No doubt we can expect the anniversaries of insignificant events in the US to be remembered one year on though. In fact, I'm willing to put money on a bet that the little shooting in the cinema this week gets a mention in one years time.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.99.69.69

Note that the 2011 Tucson shooting was added to the 8 January queue but did not appear on the main page this year.  (Conversely, the 2010 Togo national football team attack did appear.)
On what do you base the assertion that U.S. items are treated differently?  — 

On the simple fact that much of the US American population simply does not know, or chooses to disregard the fact that outside of their national borders, there are people who are not US American living in countries that are not part of US America.

 About Disputed ethnic origin of persians 

The papyri from Tebtunis record several sites in the Fayum, which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century BCE. These include the """"Village of the Syrians"""" (Syrôn kômê), """"Village of the Arabs"""" (Arabôn kômê) and Samareia, which contained a sizable Jewish population and was probably named after the city in Palestine. 

Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, """"Persian"""" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists. In late Ptolemaic and Roman contracts, """"Persian of the epigonê"""" refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.

Persians 
6 June 12 BCE
 
In this Demotic contract, summarized in Greek at the bottom, Pakemis son of Pakemis, acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife Tameische (Greek, Tameischis), daughter of Sokonopis, and promises to repay it. Here """"Persian"""" does not seem to indicate descent, but describes a man with the status of a debtor. In this example, the subject has an Egyptian personal name, but """"Persian of the epigonê"""" is just as frequently used to describe people with Greek names.

Simon Baron-Cohen image

Very kindly provided by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. It is Non-free but with permission for fair use.

Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.  

 It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  

He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other """"eminent contemporary researchers"""" as well to balance?  
Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  

Getting more images of other eminent researchers would """"balance"""" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  

I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  

I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:""",0
"Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? 

Is Wikipedia a patriarchal site? If it isn't, may I then ask why a photo of a woman reading the Quaran is constantly removed by Islamists and no-one bothers to do anything about it? I hope you are aware that this encyclopedia is opened to all people, including extremists and even terrorists. Why do your admins allow these extremists have their way? They argue that if certain people are offended of seeing a woman reading the Quaran, then perhaps the photo should be removed. Even the photographer has been convinced to have the photo removed and now he thinks it's his fault. Here's what he said: 

My wife is particularly saddened that a picture of her is causing distress - she compares it to an image of a woman in a small bikini holding a bible in the Bible article - and she has asked that the photo be removed from the article. I personally feel that the image belongs in Timur, where the woman is needed in the image in order to show scale (at least until a replacement image of the folio with a different person is found), but that it is inappropriate to include it in the Qur'an article.

Does this sound normal to you? So if these extremists, whom I dared to call Talebans, are offended by women, then perhaps we should not have woman editors, admins, etc? I suggested to you a month ago that you need to impose more Liberal standards to Wiki and enforce them with the sword! Ban these people, please!

"Toward a better description of the collapse of the SLA

There is lots of detail missing in the account of the collapse of the SLA.

The IDF, according to its plan of withdrawal, started handing major positions in Lebanon over to the SLA in the middle of May 2000. The collapse started on May 22, 2000.  Around a dozen villages and eight SLA posts in the center of the front surrendered to Hezbollah. The posts were mostly manned by Shiite muslims who were put under heavy pressure by Hezbollah. Hezbollah had made pubic threats against those involved with the SLA in April 2000. The threats were most effective against the Shites in the SLA.

Antoine Lahad, the leader of the SLA was in Paris while all of this was going on. Lahad's departure for France at such a critical time was a source of demoralization within the SLA. Lahad has claimed that he was taking an extended family vacation in advance of the July departure of the IDF. He claims to not have been aware of the handover of IDF positions to the SLA in May.

By the end of the day, the SLA front line had been cut in two with the flanks of the SLA positions in both the east and the west totally exposed to attack. On the morning of May 23, 2000, the western (Druze) sector of the front collapsed. There were (in 2000) reports of a secret deal between Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah that led to the collapse.

This triggered off a general retreat of what remained of the SLA. Shortly after, both Israelis and some elements of the SLA were moving south. The retreat was finished by the early hours of May 24.

Israeli initially announced that it would give labor visas good for one year to soldiers of the SLA.

The controversy in all this is what the Israelis really intended to do in May. Many senior figures in the SLA claim that Israel announced the July departure date while actually planning a full withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000. These SLA people claim that Israel deliberately did not tell them the depature date because of fears the Lebanese could not be trusted with the information. I dont tend to believe these sorts of stories.

My view is that the SLA collapsed out of its own internal weakness. The SLA was really multiple religious militias with no effective unified command to speak of. Hezbollah worked on breaking off the Shite and Druze elements of the SLA. The Shite portion cut a deal first. The Druze portion, seeing that the game was up closed their own deal after. Lahad probably knew what was going to happen and stayed far away.

I think most of what I've wrote can be sourced with newspaper articles from the time (May 2000). I've put this on the discussion page for informational purposes rather than the article itself because all of this would be very controversial. Maybe someday someone can rewrite the section of the article on the SLA collapse.",0

 A quick question on Aaron López 

I'm guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one I'm using on the all-time MLS club rosters: nationality by national team (including youth national teams), and in cases where there is no national team participation, nationality by birthplace.  Aaron López was born in Mexico, raised in the US, played ODP, but never made an appearance for a US youth national team...and thus counts as Mexican, correct?  You indeed have him listed as Mexican here, and since this is the most exhaustively-researched list on Wikipedia, I assume that you are aware of everything I mentioned and based your decision on those factors.  So, anyway, I'm popping in to double-check my impression: ODP does not count for purposes of determining nationality, correct? ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' """,0

 Milton Friedman etc. 

I really don't know what I've done or said to produce the attitude you're taking. You can disagree with what I say, although I personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent Klein's inclusion in the Friedman article, and I can be mistaken, as I was in my first reading of the Norberg link, but I don't see how you can take things much beyond that. Nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal, unprovoked insults with which you've decided to base this discourse. You do know, I'm sure, that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy, and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. You seem to take things fair to literally, or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. I don't mean literally that people regard Friedman as a god, and having to explain that feels rather odd but I've decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. It is simply that a large number of economists and right-wingers regard Friedman as something similiar to god, infallible and above normal human standards. If its not Friedman, than its classical economics as a whole, which is apparently beyond any external critique. That, I believe, explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of Friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.

Regarding Klein, you simply don't have a point here, its as basic as that. It it not the place of Wikipedia to judge what is """"right"""" in any particular set of affairs, but to record those opinions which are notable. Klein is a best-selling and well-regarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research, her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of Friedman is one of the most well-known in the contemporary world. It also covers far, far more than Chile. That cannot be dismissed because just because Friedman's supports or, for example, a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. As such, the rights and wrongs of Norberg's critique are fairly irrelevent. Although it could of course be included as a counter to Klein's criticism within the Friedman article, there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of Klein's views. Now I know that a lot of Friedmanite/Friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there """"laws"""" of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isn't likewise """"scientificic"""", and that presumably hold the same assumptions, but most people disagree.

Just to keep you happy, I'll discuss it briefly here. It has some very good points; for example Norberg convincingly shows there was a free-market trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond Klein's explanations (although the actual area of discussionof Klein's book were the far rarer, radical, fundamentalist reforms of the period, but more on that in a minute), he convincingly argues against Klein's account of events in Argentina and (mea culpa) China, his ridicule of Klein's """"Shock!Shock!Shock!"""" metaphor which I myself found unconvincing (as opposed to most her narrative and arguments) is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence, in many cases, of Friedman. But his 20-page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semi-accuracies, disingenuous argument and near-falsehoods as to make any suggestion that it """"proves"""" Klein wrong, or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments, completely ludicrous. I'll just list in no propersome of them since I don't have the time to do anything much else. 
He says she portrays the Chicago School as a place that brainwashed its students, as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion, whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. 
This one's just basic commone sense; he says Klein's Friedman crisis quote isn't from any important paper but a preface to Capitalism and Freedom; the preface to the guysmost important book, he defining manifesto, isn't significant? Tell that to Friedrich Engels. 
He says that Friedman gave the same advice to the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia, """"yet nobody would claim he was a communist"""", well Klein mentioned this herself, not claiming he was a communist, but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.
His suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the Chicago Boys didn't have control  until later on is simply false. While Pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along, while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will; Norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove Klein's accoun",0

"Joehazelton and a Humble question 
My humble Wikiquestion is - are editors even held accountable for libel or slander, as in real life, considering the reach and readership of Wikipedia.  What checks and balances are in place for rogue editor & admin, sophisticated in the policies, but manipulating said polices to achieve the same results.

In reading and researching, it would appear that many Editors and Admins, are behaving, contrary to the lofty goals of the Wikiproject, in order to forward personal or political agenda. Also what evidence is necessary to prove and rebuke and discipline such editors and Admin that are consistently and repeatedly violating 3RR and NPOV policy, if not in name, but certainly in sprit and in fact accuse other editors, who perform legitimate edits for the very thing that these rouges are engaged in?

Is what Wikipdia critics say is true, in that Wikipdia is the play ground of the faceless and nameless, who are not beholding or accountable to the rule of law or is Wikipdia truly has respected place, with proper review, oversight or accountability for actions, contrary to stated and publish policy?

"Roderick Usher's library, etc. 

I have moved the section on Allusions and References to other works of Art (or whatever it was called) into a subsection of Analysis along with Usher's library. I have simplified it a bit and removed some unsourced speculation that a line of Poe's was inspired by a painting of Fuseli. I'm not convinced it's 100% the way to go, but I'm worried about how much undue weight this section is being given compared to more important encyclopedic aspects of the story. Feel free to disagree.

""""Do you have any sources to suggest what these Buddhist actually call themselves? They call themselves Dalits for all I know"""".
I have the vociferous complaints of the editors on this very talk page who self-identify as Buddhist, for one.  Please read the entire talk page, I'll be happy to provide as many diffs as you like if you choose not to. For more sources, there are several websites devoted to this.  While they can't be used in the article, they certainly can be used to clear up this point.

I quite agree with you, if the internet is any indication. I've found 45 different Buddhist groups of varying strength in a directory aimed at listing Buddhist groups throughout the world (on a side note, I plan to contact as many of these groups as I can, for a seperate matter). That was just a cursory bit of research, and not aimed at that particular assertion.  I'm sure more energtic research will reveal more.

"VOTE NOW! Should Peggy Mitchell be on the Fictional erotic dancers category. 

It has been revealed during Peggy's political campaign that she was a pole dancer for the '60s gangland.  Everyone in Walford found out about this part of her past and Peggy gradually became open towards it and used it in her speech at The Vic.

I find it absolutely ludicrous that people won't accept her as a fictional erotic dancer, however, I am given the power to anyone so it could be a democratic poll.  Remember Peggy's pole dancing photo was on the Walford Gazette and she even put a photograph of this in her pub.

"Enough, these bands need to go Vol. 1 

Since someone can't just listen and understand the music, I guess it has to be done the hard way. There are plenty more that can go, but I'll start with one set.

Funeral For a Friend - the band themselves even know they aren't emo (says so in the reference), and anyone that listens to them knows they don't play emo. They don't have emo influences (Deftones, Iron Maiden, Get Up Kids) and they never played/toured with bands in the emo scene. They're nothing more than one of those melodic/post hardcore bands with the 00's decade sound.

Hawthorne Heights - see above. Same thing, no matter if it's as HH or when they were called A Day In the Life.

Ida - first of all, that reference does not even mention Ida as being an emo band. It says folk. And if you actually listen to Ida, it is nothing more than indie/folk music. Just because the guy was in The Hated doesn't mean it's emo. They never belonged here, and nowhere on their wiki page does it mention emo.

Joan of Arc - similar thing to Ida. Yes they had members of Cap'n Jazz, but they took a different direction from their old band and were playing indie rock.

The Juliana Theory - stunned that they would even be mentioned (or maybe not, given some others). Not only could you not find an influence of emo in their sound, but they're really a lot closer to the alternative scene you'd hear on any radio station than even being mentioned in the indie or pop-punk groups. Solid band, but nothing to do with emo.

Lostprophets - already mentioned somewhere around here. One little blurb by some guy that doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't count. This band never had anything to do with emo. Not saying they're a horrible band (because that's not the point). They just don't belong on a list of emo bands.

And 30 Seconds To Mars, as listed above, need to get out of here as well.",0

What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",0

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0

Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. ESPN scored for Davis. Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo!

"Sources people,no propaganda

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",1

 Referencing 

Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.

In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says """"Cite."""" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.

My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. 

Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.

I'm certain you'll have more questions, please feel free to ask.  (talk) """,0

Regardless, the vast majority of content on EphBlog reflects the views of David Kane, whether or not he frequently implores others to participate more.

Hmmm, maybe it needs to be made more clear. It is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic. Like a cocaine addict would need to be careful with say taking prescription ampetaimess, not quite the same as stimulants don't cause strong physical dependence but you catch my drift?

"""user and talk pages, and their subpages, and other non-article pages that *no others have substantively contributed to* and whose existence does *not impact the project*, *may* be courtesy blanked or deleted.""""'' But, with users who have been substantial contributors that doesn't seem to apply as 1) others HAVE substantially contributed to the pages 2) it may well have impact on the project. The only justification for this deletion would be IAR in exceptional circumstances of real-life privacy violation or harassment. If it isn't that, then there is utterly no basis in policy or consensus. The discussion on AN, which I link above, bears that out. Courtesy blanking is better in such cases. g 

It's only four talk pages. There's absolutely no need for crazy statements like """"Your deletion is improper"""". We can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletion, and deal with undeletion and courtesy blanking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request.   

I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanked them and protected them from further edits. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.   

(ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide. I'm going to take up the wider issue as a policy discussion (without naming you or this particular case). I've posted, in generalities, to the mailing list. Again sorry for my tone.g

Thank you for your support in my RfA. It was definitely a dramatic debate! I paid close attention to everything that was said, and, where possible, I will try to incorporate the (constructive) criticism towards being a better administrator. I'm taking things slowly for now, partially because it's the holiday season and there are plenty of off-wiki distractions. ) I'm also working my way through the Wikipedia:New admin school and double-checking the relevant policies, and will gradually phase into the use of the new tools. My main goals are to help out with various backlogs, but I also fully intend to keep on writing articles, as there are several more that I definitely want to get to WP:FA status! Thanks again, onka

I could ask this on the project talk page, but I'm probably just misisng a few obvious things. Please let me know your thoughts on these:
 Via the AFC category pages, I've encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are NOT under review at this time. Is that a bug? I felt like it was wasting my time.
 Similarly, a few that had already been declined.
 I'm pretty """"up"""" on WP policies (I've done thousands of edits, created a few articles myself, participated in consensus building and admin-assisted special ops, etc.). However, I'm finding it hard to deal with the Gnn reason codes and WikiProject templates. Any advice? Is this something that should really be in the script?
 What do we do with Sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed, even though they are in a review status? I'm not sure how they got there to begin with. For example, I saw a page that was obviously intended to the User main page, once he got his broken English repaired, and it was far from complete, yet it somehow had come into AfC. Really don't know how. Any idea how it got to us? Or what to do about any such article in review?
I did approve one article, but I'm not sure I did two things correctly for it. a) I did some minor, obvious content cleanup (extraneous headings on a stub, hide TOC on stub, move infobox to top). b) I saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject (a book series). AFter I approved it, I edited the automatic message on the user's talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one. Were these two actions god, bad, or indifferent?

If you think these questions belon in the project talk page, fel free. Honestly, I think this project is begging for a new-reviewer-FAQ. And maybe some screen-shot tutorial.   """,0

However, in the interests of mutual understanding, permit me to clarify a few things. Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity (I cannot speak for Islam). And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity. And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them, but again this is only true of a small segment.

DOBRUDJA (Bulgarian Dobritch, Rumanian Dobrogea), also written DOBRUDSCHA, and DOBRUJA, a region of south-eastern Europe, bounded on the north and west by the Danube, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by Bulgaria. Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.",0

I am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history, unless they are practiced historians.
(a)does not allow you to infer, and repeatedly say, that the meaning is: Nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics, nor they believe in that science.'
Where in that sentence do I state that I am unfamiliar with population genetics, and disbelieve that discipline? I am saying nothing about genetics: I am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline, namely historiography. Peer-reviewed geneticists have RS credibility as geneticists, not historians, as peer-reviewed historians have RS competence as historians, not geneticists. Sometimes you have dual competence, as with C.D. Darlington, or Jits van Straten, but the geneticists you cite, if you check the historical books in their bibliographies, use dated or unreliable sources for their history, and make frequent errors, as many reviews have shown.
(b)'You protest my writing:'What geneticists define as 'Jewishness' in Europe relates to male founder genes' and call me a racist who insults Jews.
Here you fail to understand what geneticists define as 'Jewishness'. I am not using that language, the view is not therefore mine. If you have a problem with this take it up with Harry Ostrer, whose work you keep citing, or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the DNA reveal """"a biological basis for Jewishness,""""..
Reflect on this. You keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. It's a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my English is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor, making reasonable remarks, is an antisemite.

Hi sorry if the removal was a problem it's that this is a childs programme which offered no gay suggestion and was sexless in so far as apart from friendships between the characters there was no hint as to sexuality. indeed they are supposed to be children themselves and to suggest sexuality is treading on thin ice.
1/ To quote a letter as a source is poor at best, i could write an outrageous letter myself and quote it here but it wouldn't make it right.

2/ This has been denied and moreover was a misunderstanding by the press who blew 'what if' questions out of all proportion. see link please http://www.salon.com/news/1999/02/13newsb.html

2 and a half... I find the notion that a mention of a tea cup storm made by small minded individuals should be included in a pen picture of a childrens TV show ludicrous at best but this comment is the only just comment with real founding.

3/ The outcome should be entered as i find it hard to believe it ever got to a courtroom.

1/ [edit] Tinky-Winky controversy
One of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, was the focus of a still hinted-at controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's purse (although he was first """"outed"""" by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to The Face).

2/ A February, 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal, published by Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, saying """"he is purple—the gay pride color, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle—the gay pride symbol.""""

2(and a half!) A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., who licenses the characters in the United States, said it was just a magic bag. """"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish.""""

3/ In an incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said """"I got a gun"""". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., claimed the toy acutally said """"Again, Again"""". [3]

 Merger proposal 

Basically both articles describe the same thing/process. For me, """"devoré"""" is the term that most fashion/textiles people use or know, although """"burnout"""" is also used quite often for the same process. However, I would suggest burnout (textiles) is preferable to the current Burnout (clothing) title of the other page if """"burnout"""" is deemed more appropriate than """"devoré"""". They certainly need merging, although the question is, should Devoré or an alternative Burnout page with a more appropriate title be the new home for the information? My vote is for """"devoré"""" as the term less likely to cause confusion.   """,0

You have blocked me from sending an email from this site to you and also have taken me off sending an email from this site to Riana. Below is the entire message I sent Rianna which you conveniently altered. Further, Rianna knows full well she asked for a change to the get site today because the article had not been edited for three days. She asked to change a couple of lines relating to Ms. Bruker and to remove the fact that she had an affair because it was not relevant to ths issue.  Bruno then denied her change. This was in the history of edits secions which I somewhere have saved.  Nishkid then changed the history section to show Rianna's change without the notice of line was changed. This is fraud and if an attorney did this in Federal Court, he would be disbarred and possibly charged with contempt of court. 

In response to Nishkid's question in the email to me, I think that he is not telling the truth and is equivocating about what Rianna really sent to her. From what I have read on her page, she would be quite offended at the vindictive behaviour of these men. 
I was talking to Riana at the time she saw your message, and she had no idea what you were talking about. Care to enlighten us where you first contacted Riana?

"BringIt

BringIt is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multi-player tournaments against each other for money. The site was launched in November 2008 by Woodrow Levin.

In addition to the gaming provided, the website allows users to blog, create profiles and write reviews in the forums.  BringIt includes the following platforms: XBOX 360, PS2, PS3 and Wii.  The main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.

BringIt’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount.  Players identify each other by their “gaming tag”, an online ID, and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. When the game is completed, both players report the outcome to the website, or in the alternative result, emails are automatically reported from the game’s End of Game Email Reporting System. Winning players then have their account credited.  

Founder/Chief Executive Officer

Woodrow H. Levin founded InStadium and Riverbank Capital Management. Woodrow has been featured in Media Life Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, and has been a guest speaker at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Business. Woodrow received his B.A. in Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor from the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including JUF, Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of The Chicago Green Tie Ball.

How BringIt Works

All new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. Each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. 

Our Mission

BringIt is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money.  BringIt is a community of American and International gamers with the ability to play against each other 24 hours a day 7 days a week for real money.

Legal Aspects

BringIt is not in any violation of any United States or International anti-gambling laws currently in place. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance; rather they are games of skill. Games of skill are not in violation of the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2006.  Users are required to be at least 18 years of age. Certain US State laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in BringIt’s skill based video game tournaments.

Games which may be played through BringIt’s website for real money include:

Burnout Paradise
Call of Duty 4
Call of Duty World at War
COD4
Dead or Alive 4
Fifa 2009
Fight Night Round 3,4
Forza 2
Gears of War 2
Guitar Hero World Tour

I see that you have pointed out that you are an admin.  This is good.  However, your handling of my edit to Woody Allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy.

I now understand your point about the first sentence.  I just went out and found a reliable source for Ronan's comment in the second sentence.  Ronan's comment is notable (in hundred's of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both Allen and Farrow).  I understand that I should not have put back in the first sentence, but on the other hand your edit was wrong.  Yes, I know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make Wikipedia work better (and I'm sure that Jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make Wikipedia better).  You should have only removed the first sentence (because it was not supported by a RS) which is how it ultimately turned out.  However, for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article, including the direct comment of Ronan Farrow, Allen's only biological child.  That was heavy-handed editing.  The quote is notable.  Yes, it was initially placed in the article, by another editor, with the support of a non-RS; however, it is all over the Internet.  It is quoted by literally hundreds of RS's and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a RS to replace the non-reliable source.  That would have been the correct way to handle the situation.  I hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future.

I do not """"hate"""" Columbia College; I hate seeing students waste their time. 
Here's a fact: Columbia College is unranked by U.S. News and World Report and by other major publishers of institutional rankings. This is because it is open-admissions. There's nothing wrong with Wikipedia publishing an article on this school. There is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an open-admissions art school, and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. Wikipedia is not a brochure.  
Being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. In fact, the fundamental problem with Columbia College is related to the quality it touts: it's big. It's big because it does not limit its enrollments. There is a reason for that. It's not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. If it did, it wouldn't be so expensive. It does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. 
Now, the members of its administration, its PR department, and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality: in order to make art, one needs talent. Talent is, by definition, inborn and innate. You don't get it by acquiring skill. You don't get it by purchasing the most expensive camera, or the most expensive education money can buy. You're born with it, and by late adolescence, if you've got it, it will make itself apparent. 
Therefore, any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closed-admissions art school, one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. These schools are also very expensive, but it's possible to get various kinds of financial aid. Once in the program, the talented painter, photographer, writer, or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. That creates an entirely different atmosphere, one that keeps the student on his or her toes, as it were, and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. 
You might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. It's because talent does not hide itself: it is apparent to experts in the field. 
There are two ways in which Columbia covers up this fact: by telling students that if they're showing up and willing to pay big bucks, then they're talented. It's easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she (and it's usually a he) who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. 
The other means at Columbia's disposal is that for the last thirty years, children have been taught that self-esteem is the most important quality they can develop. In a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of self-esteem, schools have simply stopped talking about talent. They might, at times call it merit, but that, too, is a bad word. So an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the """"drive to succeed,"""" you'll succeed. The problem: what if you've get the drive to succeed, but reaching down within yourself, you find you've got nothing to express?
If you think Columbia loves you, try falling behind on your tuition. Good luck.""",0

"There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you.

 Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.

There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.

And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. 

I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one). I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page.",0

You should, perhaps, check out the articles from the U.S. Dept of State. There is one on human rights in DK and one on religious freedom.

The above is not acceptable mainly because bitcoins are not solely exchanged between computers. That is not how the system operates entirely and it's in fact and understatement to the networking technology. A bitcoin transaction is simply signing the bitcoin address of another and transferring the coins. You can do that with any device. The website statement is misleading and implies people are trading bitcoins out of a library. That is not why these websites exist and you will need a citation for that claim. Even then, that's not where that claim belongs. The lead is for summarizing the article. Not adding more content.

I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being """"bastardized"""" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate """"sourced"""" information. There is substantial """"factually accurate"""" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an """"opposing view"""". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were """"out-documented"""" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.

"Hi Looie496.

Thank you for advising me of this. Appreciated. I really do love Wikipedia but I must insist that I'm allowed to love it on my own terms because I can do no other (or go without, which I candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear ...).

As I think I must surely have made clear I really do have nothing further to add to the comments about 'Buddhist sex abuse cases' I have already made. I do hope the page is restored.

Currently I'm fleshing out the biographies of  Leveller women. I've already supplied a stub for Katherine Chidley and I'm presently working on one for User:Rinpoche/Mary Overton wife of Richard Overton. It will take a few days before it's ready yet.

Mary Overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life. She was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to Millwall prison in London,an absolutely dreadful place. She refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away. They too refused out of common humanity. The bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the London streets while people spat abuse. 

Well I don't know but I think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to 'go fuck yourself' which is absolutely frightful of course. 

The baby died some six months later.

Regarding the BSAC debacle what I've done with my Katherine Chidley stub is that on the talk page I've added at the top a section for contributors in which I myself, as a contributing editor, expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it; the lack of a definition for the term 'controversialist' for example which I can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition. I'll be doing the same in all future new pages I contribute in the hope of avoiding the same difficulties I had with BSAC (assuming of course that's okay with the wiki community).

 """"Jesus and Messianic prophecy"""" 

Hey. I don't know if this is technically where I should be posting this; sorry if it's not.

1) Fine, if """"retort"""" isn't 100% appropriate then I'll use """"counter-argue""""- that is the meaning I was trying to get across.

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedia's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general.

2) You said: """"Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time-line for the Messiah's actions, and the New Testament, especially the Book of Revelation, detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later. . This is a bit vague and raises some questions. Which Christians? Where did they say that? How did they detail it? Can you reference it from a notable/semi-notable scholar?""""

First, I can't point to a place in the Old Testament where the time-line DOESN'T exist, you know what I mean? There is no Jewish time-line so it cannot be referenced. But the New Testament does have a Christian time-line, as detailed in the Book of Revelation. Now, which Christians hold to this belief? Essentially all of them- all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible, which is essentially all. Where did Christian authors detail this belief? In the Bible! How did they detail it? They wrote it in the Bible!!! That is why I made Bible references! Which scholar can I quote? How about John the Apostle, who wrote Revelation? Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject?

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing, """"Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead, as detailed in various places, including the gospels,"""" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking, """"which Christians believe that?"""". 

3) You said: This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse (Revelation 19-22). , although it does reference The Bible, if left alone, it sounds rather confusing. It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation, nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes (King James, NIV, etc) which could mean a slight difference in the quote. 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then I'll put those in, and I'll list if its KJV or whatever. But I don't think that's required as my broad citation of Rev 19-22 does clearly explain exactly what I'm talking about, including a physical kingdom on earth, a messianic age of righteousness and so on. Just because I didn't dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesn't mean they aren't there- any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters.

If I had written, """"The story of Noah's Ark is in Genesis 6-9,"""" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague? Just because I didn't give a synopsis with ten references doesn't mean it's unworthy; just look it up! 

4) What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site (the line that Christians don't believe in a physical resurrection). That line had NO references! So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post, don't they? You can't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all.

5) I'm sure you'll disagree with me on this one, but most of all, I think that my contribution didn't need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day, an age of peace etc. I feel like I'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief. 

It's almost as bad as someone posting, """"Christians don't believe Jesus was tried, executed and came back to life,"""" then I post that they do, citing Luke 20-24, then you saying that it is too vague etc. It was pure courtesy to give the citation- it's such common knowledge that Christians believe these things!

But whatever- I'll repost with a several more-specific quotes. And BTW, you may think, """"Whoa, this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia (and I'm a mod),"""" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented. (And I hate inconsistency.)

"""==WARNING: MEMBER THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan ==
There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest. THEY HAVE CONSTITUTED A WIKIPEDIAN GUNG, A GREEK PRAPAGANDA LOBBY, A GREEK EPSILON TEAM. All member of group are very radical nationalists. They work continously in three shifts over day and night.
To verify chek their  contributions, talk page, edits, deletions, blocks, directs, protected pages and act  properly. Wikipedia isn’t the right place to propagandize for “God’s elit nations” as Greece.

 The information was quite correct, and many users have remarked on various forums about this annoying disconnect between Picture Manager and other Office programs.  The most common explanation is that the alternative """"Save As"""" function is a legacy of Microsoft's acquisition of the original software from another company, but that's just a theory.

Agreed. I amended the article after the chessbase article came out. I think it's only fair to report it, without endorsing or refuting the possibility that Topalov did, in fact, cheat. Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, """"Topalov was accused of cheating"""" and """"Topalov cheated"""", so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  """,0

 Relation to gaming modules 

The first scentence of this article states that the book is """"based on a series of Dungeons & Dragons gaming modules."""" but then nothing else in the article explains or expands on this connection. I would think this article coupld be improved by putting some information in on this. Which modules exactly? How closely does the book follow the modules? what are somethings in the book not I the games, and/or vice versa? Which characters were playable and which NPC's? etc. 
I was actively playing AD&D; at the time that Dragonlance was released, I did not play the DL modules but borrowed and read the novels off a friend. My recollection was the books and novels were developed together, though it does seem reasonable that the plots of the novels were based somewhat on the original playtesting of these modules. If this is the case some of the characters were originally played by noteable people, if anyone has info on this would be something interesting. -  """,0

Speedy deletion of José Manuel Lugo, Jr.

Oh hi. Long story short so I won't be """"ranting"""" (or what not) this time:

So Sjones is wikihounding me constantly for nearly a year now, and his pal Bridies is also obsessed with me to the point of where the great most of his entire activity here on Wikipedia in the 5 months was all about how to rid of me (while I've substantionally adited hundreds of different articles during the same period, over 5,000 in total since March 2012). That's just not normal. Btw, right now I'm blocked because I referred to this wikihounding by """"stalking"""" (which is just semantics really, apparently they call it """"cyberbullying"""" now outside the Wikipedia).

Now, GAs. Basically what The Devil's Advocate wrote in his comment - and this example of the so-called """"additional evidence"""" (as it was called by Sjones in his wikihounding thread) is indeed a good example of """"evidence"""", as it shows what is actually this """"problem"""" with me - and it's that I actually know (and obey) all the policies, rules and guidelines (including but not limited to everything regarding GAs and their reviewing process), while many reviewers don't know, and even when they're informed about the rules and guidelines (the proper ones, because in this case the reviewer was misinformed by some other apparently uninformed users, strangely including at least 1 admin) they might even flatly and completely refuse to acknowledge and use them (here, the reviewer's invoking """"ignore all rules"""" instead of admitting the wrong). I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).

 Question for Gwen Gale 

Gwen, I'm asking you this question mainly because of your frequent participation at this article and its talk page. Would you consider material presented from this source acceptable and helpful if used in a proper context? Thanks.   
My question was asked in good faith. Perhaps you could find some time to answer it. Thanks.   

The only answer I can give to an open question like this is, please do see WP:RS (it's where I'd look first if I had a broad question about a source). If you'd like further input on a given citation, lots of editors other than myself watch this page, you might want to post it here and see what that stirs up, that's what article talk pages are all about. You can also try Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which at least may sometimes give one something akin to a further take on neutrality.   
Thanks, Gwen, for getting back to me. Obviously others are welcome to give further input concerning the source I asked you about. I was curious as to what your opinion was regarding The Sun as a reliable source. I read an interesting article given by Rochus Misch there.   
Misch himself didn't see everything and recall can get way fuzzy after six and a half decades, but he saw a lot nonetheless. Could you post a link to that article here? I'd be happy to read it. Thanks.   
Sorry, Gwen, for the delay in getting back to you. I actually was hoping for your opinion about """"The Sun"""" rather than about Misch. If I decide to add the information at some later point we might be able to discuss its relevancy at this talk page. For now, your opinion regarding using The Sun as a source would be appreciated.   
I'm sorry, I had missed this. I would need to see the article itself. That said, I'd be wary of citing anything from the Sun without knowing who wrote it and how it was sourced by them. Moreover, if I found something in the Sun I'd tend to dig deeper and find a source on which one could more steadfastly lean. It's not that tabloids get things wrong (all newspapers botch details, all the time) so much as tabloids tending to over-spin stuff for entertainment, which is their slice of the market, in much the same way the Times and the Guardian spin heavily for politics in some topic areas. It all makes for sloppiness, through which a cite may, say, be ok as to WP:V but then skids into the ditch owing to WP:UNDUE.   
I wonder if this relates. I would think it would be wrong to reference, edit, or dispute sources which are not at hand to be checked. Perhaps a person should only use information that they have read and can understand.  
Wm, I doubt that only  """"using information that they have read and can understand"""" would be the best criterion to use and be the most appropriate and helpful method in referencing an encyclopedia. Being partial to an exopedian version of this project (I do err from time to time myself), I think the inclusion of """"quotes"""" and anecdotal reminiscences gleaned from border line tabloids should be avoided.   
I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my pos",0

 Well, I have added an """"Example"""" section, which may give some people some intuition about, what Dembski means. The example doesn't come around all corners of Dembski's theory, but it does touch upon spme of them -)

I've read through the above and I've looked up the article in question on the NEJM website.  is correct in saying he can make basic calculations without it being considered 'original research', but your calculation is not correct. The figures involve the median survival rates, not the mean rates and as such, simply subtracting one figure from the other produces an inaccurate statistic. The median survival rate is simply the middle point between the two extremes - so if one person died after one year and one person died after two years, the median survival rate would be 1.5 years, even if 99% of people died after 1.1 years. Therefore, your figure implies something that is not the case.
The abstract explicitly states the following:
This reduction represented a 4.1-month improvement in median survival (25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T group vs. 21.7 months in the placebo group).
I think that if the survival advantage was 14.2 months, much more attention would be drawn to this figure, rather than the only figure to be highlighted of 4.1 months.

Jesus Bloodline is to be linked to """"esoteric Christianity"""" it needs to be emphasised that it is to an untraditional and modern version of """"esoteric Christianity"""" that has been influenced by Margaret Starbird. And this can be easily done. There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism """"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"""", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

"One of your contributions () is definitely extremely unbalanced und not tolerable, so there is a COI. Without this note, I would believe that this was intentional, but with your note, it seems that you are just missinformed by anti-OSS people like Eduard Bloch... Let me explain in detail:
 The text in the mentioned diff does not belong into the licensing section at all. It may be a candidate for the critisizm section on the Debian article (to explain problematic behavior of Debian against cdrtools, firefox, ...) after it has been corrected to reflect the truth.
 The named text tries to belittle cdrtools with false claims, so let me give the correct background information:
 All CD/DVD/BD drives ever made are SCSI devices.
 ATAPI is just one of many SCSI transport mechanisms and while ATAPI is fully integrated into the SCSI stack on Solaris x86 since 1993, this was not the case on Linux in 2004. This is a design problem on Linux.
 Cdrtools is highly portable to ~ 30 different platforms (not counting different CPUs separately) and the man page mentions that it grants equivalent behavior on all supported platforms
 The vast majority of all platforms do either not have device nodes at all or do not have a 1:1 relation between a specific device node and a specific SCSI device. Win-DOS and Mac OS X both do not have device nodes for SCSI devices, so 99% of all computers in the world cannot use device node based SCSI addressing.
 3) and 4) make it obvious that you cannot use device nodes in a portable implementation and that only the official SCSI addressing scheme is portable across platforms.
 In September 2004 Linus Torvalds introduced a fatal Linux kernel SCSI interface incompatibility while claiming to fix a security bug. This incompatibility was introduced exactly when a new stable cdrtools relase was puiblished after a long time of bug fixing and code freeze in cdrtools.
 The patches from Debian (Eduard Bloch) that you seem to reference and that have been published in 2004 are full of bugs. In Spring 2005, there have been aprox. 150 unique bug reports against cdrtools  in the bug tracking systems of various Linux distros. Nearly 100 of these bugs have been a result of the patches from Eduard Bloch. The other 50 bugs have been fixed in the original code between September 2004 and August 2006 after Debian stopped updating their source. BTW: As there is no development activities on cdrkit since May 2007, the vast majority of these 150 bugs is still present in the defective and dead fork from Debian. In special, there is no code in the Debian fork that works around the SCSI interface incompatibility mentioned in 6).
 cdrtools is a really openminded project. Any patch that was send and that follows the quality requirements in the CONTRIBUTING rules has been accepted. The patches from Eduard Bloch did not follow the quality rules. The cdrtools project does not accept patches that harm the code - sorry, but this is needed if you like to give long term support for a program. Note that the first libscg code was written in August 1986 (28 years ago) and that I have other OSS (e.g. star) that is maintained since 32 years.
This list of explanations can be found in the internet if you use a search engine...I did write it many times in similar wording in the past after people came up with similar false claims.
Please also note that the fork from Debian was started in May 2004 - 10 years ago. When Debian claimed to start their cdrkit fork in late 2006, they did just change the name on my request. So this cdrkit includes all bugs that have been introduced by Debian since early 2004. Cdrkit did never publish a release that has no known bugs at the time of being published, so cdrkit did never raise above alpha-release quality.

One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head.

 This article has been reviewed as part of Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force in an effort to ensure all listed Good articles continue to meet the Good article criteria. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed, listed below. I will check back in seven days. If these issues are addressed, the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted (such a decision may be challenged through WP:GAR). If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Feel free to drop a message on my talk page if you have any questions, and many thanks for all the hard work that has gone into this article thus far.
GA review (see here for criteria):

This article fails primarily on WP:LAYOUT; there are far to many embedded lists. The whole article is really just a collection of lists, with short sections of prose in between. Even the """"Programs"""" section is really little more than a list disguised as prose. There are also major problems with the referencing; there are a great number of dead links, which I have marked, and there's an unfortunate mix of inline references and external links in the text.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; I really don't think there is any way of saving this article without extensive work. Still, I will give it the normal week on hold, please contact me if anybody decides to rewrite it.   """,0

 Scientific Creationism in the opening sentence?

I wanted to bring it up here first before editing in case there was some sort of debate or discussion that already happened in the hopes I could get clarification on why we use the phrase """"scientific creationism"""" at all.  Aside from a few books with that title it's clearly not a commonly used synonym for creation science (check the google test after you remove any references to """"Scientific Creationism"""" book titles).  Additionally """"Scientific Creation"""" as a unique term doesn't seem to have any sort of definition and as such just seems pointless and redundant to use in the opener.   """,0

STOP DELETING MY ADDITION.  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:

Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are
for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a
forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked
from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT   
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.  

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; it
is less helpful for you to voice an opinion on something and not explain why  
you hold it. Explaining why you have a certain opinion helps to demonstrate
its validity to others and reach consensus.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;
 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion by other
editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, threatening people with """"admins you  
know"""" or having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 Editing  or even removing  others' comments is sometimes allowed. But you 
should exercise caution in doing so, and normally stop if there is any
objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in 
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT  
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

"Combining options 1 and 3
Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:

Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.

Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).

Whilst you're not likely to get too many defenders of FGM here, the need for the policy should be clearer for articles like abortion, for instance.

The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.  
Yes no mention at all of the Gu Gaa-fai,Wong Jim collaboration. No mention at all of the popularity of TVB TV theme songs, while everbody else was sticking their own lyrics onto somebody elses music these two, seemed to be the only people producing original material. 

 I'll try to NPOV the article more, but I claim no responsbility on contentyou can't get much further from my musical domain than Cantopop.  05:06 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 No problem.  I bet you have the chance to listen to the most popular Cantopop songs but not the best.  I will get the same preception if I listen only to Madonna or Britney Spears.

I didn't mean that I wouldn't like it.  I meant that I've never heard any, and I certainly don't know the history behind it, so my editing is limited to grammar and attempts at NPOV. )  05:23 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0

Hi - I’m User:CCFSDCA (Christopher Corbett-Fiacco) and I understand the concerns expressed by many of you regarding the articles I’ve posted at Wikipedia the past week or so.

"Deleting: Max Katsarelas 

It upsets me terribly that you found it necessary to delete a page created for Max Katsarelas.  You obviously didn't read my rebuttal to dispute the deletion. You display the insight of a 100 year old women that has suffered from Alzheimer's for 20 years. You don't even deserve a user page you PC using paper pusher.  I've said it once and I'll say it again- it's people like you, with little to no creativity and a desk job from 9-5, that get your kicks out on start up wikipedians.

So as you probably read through this and decide you're going to delete everything I have just taken the time to write, I'd like to know a few things. 

1. Do you have one of those computer chairs that has a toilet built in? If you did, I would understand why you were upset and tagged the article for speedy deletion- you had diarrhea. Aint it just the worse?

2. Are you married or still living in your mother's basement? It was a little unprofessional for me to call you out for living in your mother's basement, because, hey, most wikipedians do anyways. However, the point is, if you spent as much time reading through the edits of wikipedia as you did chasing tail like a real man, I'm sure, in fact, 100% positive you would not have tagged Max Katsarelas' page for deletion. I think it's time you get some poon. You don't know what poon is?  Here you go, read about it.

3. Do you put your wikipedia skills on your resume? Just curious.

4. Do you have cyber with any of your fellow wikipedians?

That editor then posts Wikipedia_talk:Banning_policy#Clarification_in_the_interaction_between_site_and_interaction_ban and he hopes """"it is non-controversial?"""" Oh no, of course not, it is entirely uncontroversial to go and amend POLICY in the middle of an AE enforcement to ensure that a fellow EEMLer is let off without sanction. If this has happened once, chances are it's happened before right? It would indeed be interesting have a look at the previous appearances of Volunteer Marek at AE, and see if he got off without sanction as a result of deceptive shit going on in the background. I know of one occasion it did; on that occasion Piotrus went running to Newyorkbrad and wikilawyered his EMML buddy out of yet another block. It is for that reason, upon seeing that occur, and my block being left intact, that I sent Arbcom a number of emails to ask them what the fuck they were doing. Would anyone like to have a look at other instance, and see if that held true, and who the AE closing admin was. I know the AE from last year didn't see any possibility of Piotrus getting VM out of the shit; but instead, several days into VM's massive two week block (don't worry VM, it will be an indefinite block for you soon enough), Piotrus goes and awards VM a purple heart barnstar; the purple heart of course being awarded to those injured in battle; what a nice fitting tribute to the battleground that is Volunteer Marek's talk page  it's still displayed there. Perhaps a Polish speaker can tell us what it means?

"Hi there, 
I am a new user (about two months) and live a peripatetic life, migrating from Nepal to St Paul Island, Alaska with frequent stops in Othello, Washington, where I grew up ages ago (I'm 51). I have had several 'careers' but now work as quality control and health and safety person (seasonally) for a small fish processing plant on St Paul island to finance my travels.
 
My WP editing is mostly typos and usage stuff (see slaying slews on my user page), adding links to deadend pages, and I have started participating in some AfD debates, although not many. I have created one new article, the short and rather minorly important Corfu slide.
I've had one small run-in with another editor (see Re: my copyvio tag on User talk:Noroton)regarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio. I apoligized to him although I'm not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed.
 
The primary reason I requested adoption was that I am looking for some direction on copyvio matters. I hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and I seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright, obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons, usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article! 
Looking at WP:CV I seem to get conflicting directions. The first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact, the second box (titled 'Article?') saying to revert if possible, if not then blank the page, etc.
Then I see this, '...Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future...,' in WP:C which would seem to allow most of the things I have tagged and/or deleted!

I have done different things at different times, deleted copyvio and left a stub if I think it notable, proposed speedy, blanked and listed (the 'Article?' option), and with one exception, my mistake which I apologized for, I haven't received any feedback + or -. I must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same, but still...
Here is some examples.
 

New page, West Wisconsin Telcom is a copy from the 'about' page of, you guessed it, [Wisconsin Telcom]. The page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page. 

Marriage Equality New York Inc, is copied from: here

Altoona community theatre which is copied from hereand here

What is the proper way of dealing with this?
 Propose speedy delete and leave page intact?
 No clean revert so blank and use copyvio|url=www.wwt.net/aboutus.php, and the rest of the stuff in the 'Article?' box?
 Leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business?

Wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon, abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting WP pages and policies. I have no problem being bold but also don't want to be a jerk. It would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion.
OK, that's what I'm really wondering about right now. I have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until I get some direction on this.
Thnx,",0

"USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 

I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.

ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. 

NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).",0

 Symbolism of resignation date 

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast dayCaholic online. February fest days http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this shoud be added in hid biography.   
WP:SYNTH   
Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  
It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France).

"Controversies - Did he had conspired 9/11? 

I don't want to make Wikipedia offended (primarily the article), but I think it's strange that he had financed to implode the buildings on the World Trade Center. I don't think it would be relevant in the article by Wikipedia's standards or if I would receive a notification on disruption or something like that. Here I go. 

He is a Jewish person right? He wanted to implode the buildings for a war on Islam. Secondly, there was a television tower on top of the World Trade Center - does that seem weird to you people? That was all done for capitalism, propaganda, scare tactics, exploitation and viewers? No one talks about that. The television agencies wanted them to blame Islam for good measure, because of oil.  Oil, television agencies, government power, and lobbyist, in a government operated building. This man who had made up 9/11 is Jewish… It was all over religions… Jews versus Islams… Now governmental Jews are in power again only because of this incident …
Just months before 9/11, there was over $3.4 trillion dollars financed to the city, and they agreed to this situation; however, he had gained profit from the victims, which he's at $7 billion (USD). He had knew about the asbestos before he had bought the World Trade Center in 1980's. Plus the towers of 2, 3, 4, and 7 - were over $10 billion (USD - with tax).

Don't worry... I surely complain also about the Italians!

Brr... chills of disgust.  Even Piedmont (I am in Turin now) which was traditionally leftish, now has a total Northern League jerk as governor.

Seriously, I really admire Anglophone and Nordic civilizations, and I honestly think you (and Australia in particular) are far better than us in 90% of life things (and 90% of what remains comes from our past). Again honestly, in the matter I got disappointed since I always had a very big picture of Times and British journalists in general (while 90% of Italian ones are renowned to be just serfs of they payers), but for once I understood that journalist made a big mess and did not study in depth the matter.

http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU=

Hindi emerged as Apabhramsha, a degenerated form, in the 7th century A.D. By the 10th century A.D., it became stable. 'Braj, Awadhi, Khari Boli etc are the dialects of Hindi'. The present literary standard of Hindi is based on 'Khari Boli'. Hindi became the official language of India after 1947
http://hindinideshalaya.nic.in/english/hindi_orgin/briefhistory.html

Where are other languages of India ? What about Braj bhasha, Khadi Boli, Awadhi, Chattisgariya  ? They can call Hindi as much as Urdu speaking people are calling Hindi as Hindustani. The Hindi I speak has more Punjabi & English words than Urdu. The list goes on.

Instead, it is up to those who deny they happened to prove they did not...One of these days I should try to get a foundation to underwrite a trip to central Africa.

Incidentally, if you're keen to keep your assessing skills honed, we are currently very short of reviewers for Milhist A-Class reviews. Broadly, the five A-Class criteria are just beefed up versions of the B-Class criteria and anyone with B-Class experience should have no trouble with them. Also, as a reminder, in the wide-ranging A-Class review, it is not necessary to comment on all five criteria: if you're short of time, you can simply focus on the aspects that interest you most (sources, comprehensiveness, prose, graphic content or whatever).

Biography and creativity
 
[edit] Early years
 
Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.
 
[edit] Star Factory
 
Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added

In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and """"Leila"""".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.
 
[edit] """"Post-factory"""" life
 
[edit] 2005—2006
 
After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song """"Leila"""" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"""") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""""Хочешь, я тебе спою"""")
 
[edit] 2007
 
In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.
 
She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».
 
In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.
 
In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was """"star"""", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.
 
With Alexei, Vika wrote a song """"Needle"""", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.
 
Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».
 
[edit] 2008— present
 
On 6 March 2008 She released a debut album """"Needle"""". The album became «the collection of hits of the singer» as it was the first album for 3 years of work. Now Victoria begins work on the second album.

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].
while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact
that red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses
for the complete """"zitadellecampaign"""" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-

I have tried many times to remove Prague Process from that subheading, and i presume it was you who kept putting it back there because nobody else seems interested in this article. I propose calling it """"Aftermath"""" and deleting everything that the sources do not link as a direct consequence of the PD. """"Aftermath"""" means """"Aftermath of the Prague Declaration"""" not """"similar things that happened after the PD was declared"""". To use an admittedly oversimplified analogy - if some MEPs made a declaration calling for the Sun to rise and fall each day, you could not say that daylight was part of the """"Aftermath"""" of their declaration.
And again, about the """"rejection"""" - Can we use the wording """"kept under review, pending legal changes that are highly complicated and will probably never happen due to a lack of enthusiasm and a lack of perceived necessity?"""" No, I think rejection is more accurate. so does the Guardian. It's not my POV, it's simply what the word """"rejected"""" means in plain english. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism

An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and neutral, but still be disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.

I hope it's clarified. The ideas were connected in my head, but I did not mean to imply that you want PHG banned solely or even predominantly because of incivility. I agree that PHG needs to better accept criticism and learn a thing or two about reliable sourcing (hence my emphasis on OWN and RELIABLE), but I have yet to see the evidence (which isn't to say it doesn't exist) that he """"pour[s] bad information and fringe theories into Wikipedia"""". Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.

 Strange edit 

Can you explain this edit? It seems to me to replace perfectly good punctuation with strange punctuation that makes nonsense of the sentence. Have I misunderstood? I don't understand the edit summary comment about """"reject[ing] the Wikipedia ethos"""", but whatever you think of an editor, that does not justify reverting a perfectly constructive edit.   
I have no problem with the commasbut the previous """"edit summary"""" was obscene and disgusting and degrading to Wikipedia and could not be allowed to stand.  
I agree that the edit summary was unhelpful (though """"obscene and disgusting and degrading"""" seems somewhat of an overstatement). However, to revert a good edit because you don't like the accompanying edit summary makes no sense, and besides, the edit summary still does stand, as reverting the edit does not remove the edit summary.   
the statement I consider obscene, disgusting and degrading was """"who wrote this originally? an illiterate american(did I just repeat myself), or a fucking 2 year old?)"""". That bespeaks an editor who does not respect the Wikipedia ethosand a """"comma fanatic"""" willing to make such outrageous statements over a trivial comma issue.   
The comma in question does seem to have affected the meaning of the sentence—it is not the sort of """"take it or leave it"""" comma which only a comma fanatic would insist on. We may therefore be dealing with some sort of all-purpose grammar fanatic, who threatens myriad rude improvements. Only time will tell.   
OK, Rjensen, thanks for pointing that out. I had assumed that you were referring to the edit summary in the edit that you reverted in the edit I linked to.

 If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral. 
She says """"common usage in Ireland [so] describes (then and now), local inhabitants who give information to the British."""" 
But Ireland then and now also includes the Protestant north whose Protestant inhabitants see themselves as British and would no more think of not 'informing' than would an American who spotted an Al Quaeda operative setting up an ambush in Chicago. And they would not be pleased to have the epithet 'informer' thrown at them. 
Irish Protestants in the south then, or the north now would never use the word 'informer' in this context and their view should not be disregarded in Wikipedia.

"Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back Seat
Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Quigley's book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff's """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):
""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""
Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""
Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""
That's it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley's assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There's no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel.

If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 6000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """,0

Fair use rationale for Image:AnimaPromotion.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AnimaPromotion.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,0

"""It does not matter if they disclaim it's truthfulness. What matters is if they adhere to its teachings. There are some within the Church, sadly, who do not believe the Book of Mormon to be true - rather they believe it is inspired, non-historical scripture, or that it contains good teachings. Some of these would say the Book of Mormon is the word of God, others may not. However, they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to Mormonism.

New sub-catagory

I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:

→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.

→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. 

→ The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, """"I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais."""" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.

We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.""",0

"If you're talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs, I do not agree to that standard.  The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.  When a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda, I tell them how I feel to their face.  Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.
I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.  It's all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power, but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right.  I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.

Er let me see:
Prose vs lists: Perhaps Prose is better than just plain lists (although some people seem to like and want lists, there are loads of """"list of...."""" articles, which show the demand for it).  The nature of this particular article does tend towards bullet points: people usually want to make several points about the same subject, list several authors etc, and this is difficult to do coherently using prose.  The idea of bullet points was invented to overcome this very problem, and is becoming more common in modern prose.  (the only disadvantage is that it is worse if you read it aloud).  I have tried to plain lists, so for example I added a couple of lines (usually taken from their own Wikipedia pages) for some of the critics or responders whose only appeared as names.

The problem with reliable sources. I am only copying in the pre-existing references.  But the real problem is that there is no definition of reliable, and being reliable is not quite the same as important.

"""==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==

There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, """"The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School"""". As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.174.89.27.124  

I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.254.17.230   

The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article. 174.89.27.124  

They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  """"Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About  

So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view? 174.89.27.124  

I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), """"Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.""""  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph. 174.89.27.124  

The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its """"sister school"""" for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.

 From Loomis 

I guess I just missed your question. I rarely if ever ignore the challenge of an intelligent question. In fact, I'm sure you've noticed in my posts that I tend to repeat my philosophy over and over (perhaps too much!). I strongly believe in what's called the Socratic Method. By that I mean that I believe that the best way at arriving at (something at least close to) the truth is by asking questions, rather than stating opinions. 

Unless a question is completely insulting or moronic, I consider it a challenge to answer it. If I can't answer it properly, I force myself to rethink the matter.

Your question was a good one, and it may take a bit of research on my part because, while I do believe I have a good deal of knowledge on the subject, you've touched on a couple of details I wasn't completely familiar with. Maybe I was just being lazy by overlooking your question. Or maybe it was because I just felt the rest of you guys have had enough of my opinionated and controversial posts, that I thought I should just leave it alone, and give you guys a break.

In any case, I'll definitely give it some good thought and I promise to get back to you, ok! (Don't worry, don't feel like you're giving me """"extra work"""". I'm actually flattered that you'd be interested in my response! I'll be more than glad to develop an answer, especially knowing that someone is actually interested in it!)

I just have a few questions for you. I'm just curious about a few things. For one, I'm very curious about the name """"Evilbu"""". Does it mean something in Flemish? (Is the """"Flemish language"""" really any different from Dutch? I speak French and when I visited Belgium, their French was completely comprehensible, with the exception of a few odd words like """"septant"""" rather than """"soixant-dix"""" for """"seventy"""", etc). Also, you said something about you """"being too young"""". You don't have to answer any of these questions, I respect privacy. But if you don't mind, how old are you? Finally, you say you're """"not a Zionist"""". That can mean one of two different things. One is that you're simply not a Zionist the same way as I'm simply not a Belgian. I've got nothing against Belgians, I'm just not Belgian. Similarly, you could have just been saying that you're simply not a Zionist. You've got nothing against Zionism, you just simply aren't one. Of course it could also mean something very different. It could mean that you're against Zionism.

But that's ok too. I'm sure you know this, but the Jewish religion is a non-proselytizing religion. What that means is that we don't go around knocking on people's doors trying to convince them to become Jewish. In fact, we don't even find it necessary to explain or rationalize our faith to others. What we believe is what we believe, and what you believe is what you believe. No need to """"sell"""" our religion to anyone else.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is because unlike Judaism, Zionism, to a certain extent, has to be explained, clarified and rationalized to others. So what I'm saying is that while I won't even bother explaining Judaism (unless of course you're curious, and even then, it would be in a totally """"interfaith"""" manner, respecting whatever you are and not trying to change it,) I believe it's my duty as a Zionist and as a Jew to help you to understand why we, as Jews, believe so dearly, that it is so incredibly important that we have a homeland, a safe haven.

Here is part of the 1957 paper, """"The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System"""" by Backus, et al., this snippet on the FREQUENCY statment and its use in a compile-time Monte Carlo simulation of the run-time to optimise the code generated. Quoting ...
The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has a single entry point and a single exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by an actual """"execution"""" of the program in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO'S is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.

 I  define ignosticism as the notion that as His attributes are incoherent and contradict each other, He is meaningless, conrary to my friend David Ramsay Steele who finds Him understandable. What I mean is that whilst one can fathom the  definitions of His attributes and Him, their incoherence really means that He means nothing.
 David states that had scientists resorted to verification, they'd have overlooked atoms and now- superstrngs,  but right before that he states in principle. Indeed, those two matters in principle were knowable whilst God defends on theologian's it must be's and guesses [ John Hick really guesses in dealing with the problem of evil1].

When did I say I find anything offensive. I merely told you what ethnic Macedonians think. Do you even know English? I did not state my view at all. If I was irredentist I would have said temporary control. And I said nothing about Bulgarians anywhere. I only mentioned the blue corner, never  Blagoevgrad/Pirin (the Green corner if you will). Laveol, you are suggesting that the blue corner is Bulgarian! You are offended because my """"irredentism"""" conflicts with yours. And now, I will, for the first time, point a Bulgarian editor to hypocrisy. Feel free to point me to sarcasm. 
And Avg, the ethnic Macedonians call their land, in their everyday speech, plain vanilla Macedonia as well. The only difference is the two versions are written in different alphabets and have different syllabic emphasis.

 Which English to use? 

Hi!  I saw your comment on Scientizzle's talk page, but since he's on wikibreak I thought I'd step in.  You can read the official policy at WP:ENGVAR.  If an article has a strong connection to a particular country (e.g., Harry Potter, Abraham Lincoln), the spelling should reflect that country's standards.  There are other rules, of course, but the most important this is not to change a word just because you spell it differently.  If the article uses """"colour"""" throughout, it should stay """"colour"""".  You can, however, change words to make the spelling consistent throughout the articlefor instance, if it's spelled """"manoeuvre"""" in the first and third paragraphs but """"manuever"""" in the second.

Section on Turkey
Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue. 

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections. 

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

""""Turkey
On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]""""""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6   

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide.  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime).  

Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. 

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information. 

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section.

I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa.

The idea that the recursion theorem can be avoided by a reference to some sort of """"quine lemma"""" is interesting, but there is no result well-known as the quine lemma, and the result needed here is not just the existence of a quine but the existence of a fixed point for a certain recursive operator.

Hello, Wood Dickinson. I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as """"Article that has no meaningful, substantive content"""". Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was """"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference"""" followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I """"don't see any value"""" in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have """"placeholder"""" articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect """"we haven't written this page yet, but we will"""" does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a """"userspace"""" page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called User:JamesBWatson/Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.
I give up quite a significant amount of my time to Wikipedia administration. Unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism, trivia, propaganda, uninformed adolescent speculation, illegal content, and other unhelpful stuff. If there weren't people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess, Wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. You are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wikipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to help implement those policies, but I disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as """"trolling"""".
I hope these comments will be helpful to you. If you have any further questions about these matters, please feel welcome to contact me here again. However, I have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about Wikipedia work, especially not calls from one continent to another.   """,0

"Mauryan Empire/Ashoka Support=
Hello again Vastu,

    As you know, there was an edit war on the mauryan empire and ashoka articles on account of PHG's insistence on positing that ashoka was descended from greeks, in spite of what is stated in the ashokavadana, and establishing it as the mainstream view.

I know you're busy with other stuff, but we're both concerned about the historical accuracy of these articles, so that's why I want to include you. I suggested the creation of an ashoka origin page, along the lines of one created for Chandragupta (to move theorizing and opinion off the maing page).

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

"I appreciate you taking the time to have a look at the edit history. Yes Codf1977 was always very active whilst 'semi-retired, but although they made a couple of edits after their 'retirement' their activity had fallen off almost completely (predictably one of their very few 'retirement' edits was to revert an action that I had made here: []) and on quite a few days there was no activity at all on the account. 

 VHarris44 was clearly not someone completely new to Wikipedia. That much is very clear from their skill in navigating Wikipedia, such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting Advert tags on articles, right from the first day of their activity. This is someone who had prior experience on Wikipedia. It is also I believe reasonably well established that VHarris44's behaviour towards me was inappropriate, they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. There is also the issue of VHarris44 having known details about my university. Did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? That has to be extremely unlikely. 

 So the obvious question is, who is VHarris44? A very logical possibility is, another experienced user that I have serious disagreements with. To my knowledge there is only one user in that category. Now in view of the timing of that user's retirement, the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that I had created deleted, the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits, and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with VHarris44, this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that VHarris44 and Codf1977 are the same person.  So was Codf1977's detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with VHarris44 here: User talk:TFOWR#Rangoon11's filing of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Codf1977 and his other actions yesterday.

 In terms of the spelling mistakes made by VHarris44, I have looked again myself and concede that I cannot immediately find examples of the same spelling mistake in Codf1977's writing, but equally I cannot find exactly the same text written by Codf1977 in which those mistakes occurred (i.e. I can't find an example of Codf1977 saying 'no one agrees with you' or 'know one agrees with you'). They both seem to have poor spelling. 'such big changes must be agreed in talk page' is an edit description which both Codf1977 and VHarris44 have used. Ultimately there is little text written by VHarris44 to go on though. 

 I do not believe it a absolute certainly that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, merely that the circumstantial evidence in that direction is very strong. I can accept that others do not feel the evidence sufficient. However I have been blocked on the grounds of harrassment for making a complaint based upon that circumstantial evidence. That seems very unfair, for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, I really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that I saw and therefore relate to why I felt compelled to post a message on the admin board.",0

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  Jim's not an admin, so he asked me to investigate this.  The thing is, it's against Wikipedia policy to block a user or an IP address based on the idea that they might vandalize again.  This IP address is associated with a school, which explains why there's a high incidence of vandalism coming from it.  However, there may be contributors there who make constructive edits, and we don't want to discourage or preclude them from contributing.  What we can do is to make sure that our vandalism fighting efforts are strong and enact a number of short-term blocks if the problem worsens.  Vandals can't """"destroy files""""; all they can do is make a temporary mess that is fairly simple to fix.  If you're interested in fighting vandalism, you can read about it here and learn about reverting vandalism here.  Happy editing!    """,0

 Original founding directors 

You claim: - """"I don't think a school prospectus is a reliable source."""" How so? Surely a school knows who its Board of Directors is?  Not only is it a direct source but by law (in the UK) the information MUST BE CORRECT. To name directors who are not in such a position is a criminal offense under the Company (Disclosures) Act (1985/6 revision and 2002 revision) which also requires the propectus includes the company ID number and the VAT number. As such it is a legal document.

Disclosure of names of directors
8.—(1) Where a company’s business letter includes the name of any director of that company, other than in the text or as a signatory, the letter must disclose the name of every director of that company.
(2) In paragraph (1), “name” has the following meanings—
(a)in the case of a director who is an individual, “name” has the meaning given in section 163(2) of the Act; and
(b)in the case of a director who is a body corporate or a firm that is a legal person under the law by which it is governed, “name” means corporate name or firm name.

Further particulars to appear in business letters, order forms and websites
7.—(1) Every company shall disclose the particulars set out in paragraph (2) on—
(a)its business letters;
(b)its order forms; and
(c)its websites.
(2) The particulars are—
(a)the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered;
(b)the company’s registered number;
(c)the address of the company’s registered office;
(d)in the case of a limited company exempt from the obligation to use the word “limited” as part of its registered name under section 30 of the Companies Act 1985(3) or article 40 of the Companies (Northern) Ireland Order 1986(4), the fact that it is a limited company;
(e)in the case of a community interest company which is not a public company, the fact that it is a limited company; and (f)in the case of an investment company within the meaning of section 833 of the Act, the fact that it is such a company.

 Background 
21st Century Democrats started out relatively small but has quietly grown in size and significance in the last few election cycles.  In 2004 election cycle, according to the Political Money Line, it was the 13th largest Political Action Committee (PAC) in the United States raising nearly $7 Million.  Among progressive ideological PACs, it ranked fourth behind America Coming Together, EMILY's List, and MoveOn.org.  The group's long time Executive Director Kelly Young left the organization in 2007. Former Executive Vice President Mark Lotwis took over as Executive Director in July 2007.

Unlike traditional PACs, 21st Century Democrats focuses on recruiting, training, and hiring field organizers to organize grassroots campaigns on behalf of candidates for local offices, statewide office, and even targeted presidential swing states.  The strategy enables the group to get a value added return on its investments, and has proven to be successful. 21st Century Democrats wins the majority of its races, even though they focus on tougher, competitive races up and down the ballot.  The group has strong ties to veterans of Paul Wellstone's campaigns, as well as Democracy for America, which grew out of Howard Dean's failed presidential campaign. {{| url = http://democracyforamerica.com/about}} ,

"drprinceton

The way wiki immediately took down the 8 prime spirals pages and the minor referer pages about the person that discovered it way back in 1995 who also has a new project known as HelixQ is a joke.

Let's see the argument of wiki is that the 8 Prime Spirals are not 'peer reviewed', in academia anything involving crypto and national security has been censored for decades and in 1995 when the original paper came out revealing numerous new prime theory that was years ahead of prime theory then, there was no way for such work to even be published, so USENET was how it was distributed, and it's a fact usenet has been heavily edited involving the topic.

Now you can all point to your rules about 'peer review' but this shows how ignorant everyone thus far is about academia and censoring of math involving primes and crypto. Let's see wiki has a page on Dr. Bernstein, a guy that took the NSA to court in 1995 the same year the paper was released, so that's how restricted publishing prime theory as it relates to crypto was in 1995, and is still today.

You expect NSA funded journals like AMS to allow such information to be 'peer reviewed'?

Anyway, my original article was 'heavy handed' killed by 'mods' at wiki and if you don't think the NSA has infiltrated wiki and almost every type of mass social media on the net (and yes to me wiki is a social media/project) then you need to read on the Snowden documents.

So the article put a light on some very interesting 'prime theory' that is supported by GitHub, anyone can check the github cite to see the info that every so-called prime algorithm and many have pages on wiki, all failed to outperform a 2300 year old algorithm, aka sieve of Eratosthenes, all expect for one algorithm, a prime spiral algorithm that I KNOW has been around since 1995 and a theory that has been heavily censored by the NSA since almost any reference to the many posts about ENNISA Prime Formula has been erased from Usenet, the original 'social media' of the net.

That all being said, I'm constantly now being 'threatened' by who? Mods that think me insisting the removal of the original page is suspect to obvious manipulation most likely by the NSA?

Prove wiki has no NSA bots or mods controlling the discussion, put the page up and let it be edited properly. 

The original article was what I would think any real mod not working for the NSA would agree was pretty NPOV, and the 'cite' to github verified the whole claims, that a new prime algorithm is beating all known prime algorithms, something the other wiki page prime algorithms do not do.

The original article referenced the discover is connected to obvious 'disinfomation' as well, and the continued supression of anyone discussing his work and him as was done by wiki in this article is defacto proof that the PTB want to keep the public and academia in the dark about significant advancements in prime theory.

Anyone can google NSA and the major journals you think are 'peer reviewed', what do you see searching NSA and AMS, oh it's funded by the NSA. LOL

That's your 'peer review', so any real mod here can step in and put the original article back. The PyPrimes test of the algorithm shows how major this work is.

Then the public can decide who discovered it, I know the origin is 1995 and 1997, I've been following it that long, and to see wiki put up pages about a slow 60Mod algorithm from 2004 that was discussed in the same prime work in 1995 is a joke.

Then you start to peel away who are the guys involved in all this new crypto and prime work and you start to see nothing but NSA funded projects.

What you don't think the NSA had laws in place for decades banning such work? They did. And now they control the academic journals with funding to furthr control what is released about anything that can impact crypto and the heart of crypto is what, PRIME NUMBER THEORY.

The mere fact that a project that is open to PUBLIC SCRUTINY by competent computer programmers has shown for over two years a new prime algorithm is the so-called king of the hill of prime theory, and wiki mods and most likely NSA/wiki mods are doing their best to treat the PyPrimes speed tests like they are insignificant.

The fact is PyPrimes exposed how advanced the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni was by it beating all the major prime algorithms.

The fact is PyPrimes referred to the 1995 30Mod Prime algorithm as 'Croft Spirals', which is a joke since Croft created his site about the theory in 2010, then in 2012 PyPrimes picked it up, and now wiki is saying so what, there's a new prime algorithm that dethroned every prime algorithm wiki has pages on.

It is understandable why some may not like the fact that the UB has been displayed prominently by militant loyalism (as outlined in flag articles linked from the NI page), but why should such loyalists be able to hijack the only signifcant flag that has ever represented NI as a region? Many people also don't like the Irish Tricolour either because of it's association with militant Irish Republicanism, but does that mean that militant Irish Republicans should be allowed to hijack the tricolour and we should demand that the tricolour is removed from the Republic of Ireland/Flag of Ireland pages?  22:01, 21""",0

According to Wikipedia's """"Five Pillars,"""" Wikipedia is an encylopedia, not a newspaper.  The photo of Cynthia's mugshot is something that would be seen in a tabloid newspaper, Entertainment Weekly, or People Magazine (and that's only if they were desperate that week), not an encylopedia.  The difference between her mugshot photo and the celebrities that you've mentioned is that they are CELEBRITIES, and I feel she isn't a celebrity.  Everyone you mentioned is famous enough AND/OR their crime was (in)famous enough to warrant a mugshot photo.  

If the reason of keeping the photo is that it relates to the article, I say that the drunk driving section is overkill.  It's tabloidism.  Granted, she isn't completely unknown to the public or unpraised by critics, but the entire drunk driving arrest section should be a blurb.  Also, her fame (or lack thereof) and the lack of severity or newsworthiness of the crime (even though I loathe drunk driving) is why the photo should be removed.  I think almost everyone else on this discussion page agrees with the photo removal.""",0

 Problems with the new introduction 

First paragraph:
1. No one """"discovered"""" Ancient Egyptians: they have been known to their neighbors since the dawn of civilization. 
2. """"Everyone seems to enjoy"""" is not a phrase one should use in an encyclopedia article. 
3. Speculating on the reasons certain scholars are involved in this discussion is just a step away from an argumentum ad hominem.

Second paragraph:
The 'Eurocentrist' position (i.e. that Ancient Egypt was predominantly Caucasian) is still excluded, which makes the intro biased.

Third paragraph: 
""""it is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time"""" is pure speculation (i.e. POV, i.e. original research: how did you come to this conclusion?)

====
The racial identity of ancient Egyptians has been steeped in controversy ever since the discovery of their existence. Everyone seems to enjoy the mysterious nature of the Ancient Egyptians and for many different reasons, be it for prosperity or to clear historical inaccuracies, want to claim them as their own. 

There are many different opinions on their racial makeup. One opinion among some scholars is that ancient Egypt was a multi-racial society. Another opinion held by other scholars is that that ancient Egyptians were black African peoples, claiming that this """"black identity"""" was strongest in early Egyptian history and waned over time. They also assert Egypt remained essentially a black African civilization throughout the dynastic era. Then we also have many other historians reluctant to make definitive claims about the skin color of its inhabitants. 

Although the mainstream position has changed over time,it is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time.

I like the French image. Again, just to sorta re-state where I'm coming from, even if the nebulizer girl was perfectly lit in high resolution, the main trouble is that this doesn't """"look"""" like cystic fibrosis. There's absolutely nothing in it to the layman which says """"this is what cystic fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis alone, looks like"""" - it's a girl with a breathing mask. The image could be used in the treatment subsection (where I originally placed it) or somewhere else in the article, but the top image should be as singularly """"cystic fibrosis"""" as the title itself. For diseases like, off the top of my head, lupus, clubfoot, ALS, spina bifida, or Downs syndrome, images of people could be very suitable for the lede. But for other diseases, a picture of a person suffering from the disease really doesn't work - a person with a runny nose could have the flu, or could just have allergies. There's nothing so strikingly visual about how the flu manifests itself in a human being that justifies a picture of a person with the flu in the lede when a picture of the bug itself can be used. Same with Tay-Sachs, or Alzheimers, or AIDS - none of these articles have a picture of a human being in their lede, and for good reason. It's an article about cystic fibrosis, not """"living with"""" cystic fibrosis, and as such, we should strive to present readers with an image that's as singularly CF as possible. The image of the girl is cute and touching and is suitable enough for the """"treatment"""" section, but is unfitting of being the lead image in the article.   """,0

""""arbitrarily"""" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article
""""warmongering"""" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here.  There are many other better words.
The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself.  So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country?
The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection.  Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate?
The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.  In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here.

"""

 Dear Michael, thanks for your reply. Once you introduce torsion, there is this critical uncertainty about what the """"minimal coupling"""" means. The coupling that decouples the torsion altogether always has to be allowed - and it's probably the right one. There are various other fundamental problems - that it's not really clear what the theory should be to describe the real world. Even if you want to couple Einstein-Cartan theory to ordinary electromagnetism, there exists no candidate for a """"minimal coupling"""". Moreover, the newer, more well-defined versions of the Einstein-Cartan theory, e.g. due to Stelle and West (involving non-commutativity as a justification), actually predict big enough phenomena and can be falsified. For both claims, see e.g. the 2009 paper by Gibbons et al.  (the falsification is described in the comment about 1,000 seconds; Gibbons is a senior guy who wrote important papers with Hawking and others). I think it's valid to say that any concrete enough version of the theory - including couplings to known types of matter - can be falsified and has been falsified. So the concept is only surviving as a vague one, with a wishful thinking that there could still exist a viable version of it. But no such version is known - at least not a natural one. What's really missing is the motivation. In string theory, one can see that there's no torsion, perhaps except for the H-field (a 3-form) but the H-field doesn't have the usual normal properties of the Einstein-Cartan torsion field. In fact, in 4D, the H-field may be Hodge dualized to a scalar, the universal axion, and such fields are naturally massive - otherwise new long-range forces would have to exist but they don't. If they were not massive, you would really modify the GR even at long distances, and created new polarizations of gravitational waves, altered the prediction for gravitational lensing, and other things. All these things are absent according to observations as well as string theory. Moreover, the very idea about the """"minimality"""" of the couplings has been changed in the 1970s by the insights of the renormalization group. We no longer prefer """"simple"""" couplings because they look aesthetically and subjectively simple but because we can technically prove that these couplings - and low-derivative terms - prevail at long distances. This modern kind of reasoning leaves no natural room for torsion. So  all the motivation is just historical in character and can't be reconciled with the modern way of organizing fields and terms in field theory, and the people who defend it don't understand the last 60 years in theoretical physics.

"""

 Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes 

The main Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.

Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.

The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.

I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.

The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.

As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.

Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.

Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on """"Controversies"""" which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.

You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, """"Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness"""". Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.

It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell """"biography"""" page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.

I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.

The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:

The article accuses me of making public """"plagiarism"""" accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the """"reporter"""" who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.

The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of """"plagiarism"""" after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.

The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor",0

From a purely WP:LEAD point of view, the article has several sections devoted to cores and the requirement for ferromagnetism is stated prominently.  It is a reasonable summary to have the ferromagnetic core requirement in the lead.  The argument that not all ferromagnetic materials make good cores is irrelevant to the statement that all cores must be ferromagnetic.  This is the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent; all A are B is not invalidated because some B are not A.  That some new material for cores might be discovered that is not ferromagnetic is WP:CRYSTAL and also irrelevant, certainly not encyclopaedia worthy.

pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:
""""However, a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. The fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial; Grossman's personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.""""
""""Ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an impressive, enormous body of work...""""
""""At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman's designs are available.""""
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don't see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V.

Excuse me, but why did you lock the page? Do you understand what is going on here? Because over at WP:ANI it doesn't appear I'm being understood and the case was closed with nothing being resolved. I reverted 's edits of making the table width 70% wide because she said it was for """"standard screen sizes and known issues"""". I asked her what she meant by that and where I can find a discussion that there is a standard screen size for Wikipedia and where others are having the problem. She did not provide any reasoning and simply attacked me for undoing her edits. I believe is full of crap and wants things catered to her personal preference. It has now gone beyond a matter of the this article's table size. It's a matter of this spoiled brat trying to get her way.   """,0

"Plot summary issue: sniper scope tampering 

The plot summary states the following:
Unbeknownst to the Doctor the assassin is actually among the delegates. He pulls out a pistol  when the Doctor reaches the camera level and shoots the President dead. The crowd sees the Doctor on the catwalk firing the sniper rifle (in an attempt to stop the assassin) and assume he is the killer.
I don't think this is correct.  The cut when the Doctor fires strongly implies that it is HE who shot the president (a fake-out that's the focus of the cliffhanger, in fact), and not the man in the crowd.  Also, it's later revealed that the scope on the Doctor's sniper rifle was tampered with.  I'll have to go and check, but it's always been my impression that the scope was tampered with in just such a way that when the Doctor attempted to fire on a would-be assassin in the crowd who was standing in just the right spot, his staser bolt would hit the president instead, in a perfect frame-job. 76.126.142.59",0

 Re: Ridiculous bands listed as supergroups 
I completely agree with this sentiment. Theres something wrong when there are 10+ groups listed as supergroups from 2005-2006. A band that forms with members that have been in previous bands does not automatically make it a supergroup. The last few bands listed dont belong in this article.


 I don't think it should matter whether the previous bands are household names, but I DO think they should be removed from the article if they weren't formed with promotion from previous bands. For example, several of the 2000s bands are promoted as such: Velvet Revolver was promoted as """"Stone Temple Pilots meets Guns n' Roses"""", Audioslave was promoted as """"Soundgarden meets RATM"""", Army of Anyone is being promoted as """"Filter meets STP"""", etc. In other words, bands with promotion like The Raconteurs being """"Jack White with a band"""" aren't supergroups, because they're widely known as Jack White's side project, and NOT """"White Stripes meets The Greenhornes"""".

ChrisB???
Who elected ChrisB as """"god"""" of the Supergroup article?  I thought Wikipedia was about discussion and reaching consesus (sorry about the spelling there).    

I've moved this here from Supergroup (music) - if there is another meaning of the word, I think somebody should write about it before we add parentheses to things. It's easy enough to move things back later. 

Whatever it is, it's pretty thin soup, if you'll pardon the pun.  I'd give you CSNY, ELP, Travelling Wilburys, and the Bloomfield-Kooper-Stills session, but the rest are pretty much bands (some great maybe, never even heard of Sky), that sold a lot of records.  

 Ridiculous Bands listed as Supergroups 
It seems that people are using this page to promote their own bands, or own obscure tastes, which they find """"super."""" I agree with the aforementioned, and will weed out some of the lesser-known acts, and those featuring lesser-known musicians. Feel free to restore this page, if you believe that I'm wrong. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) 23:02, December 14, 2004  (UTC)

I believe the text at the top of the page does a pretty good job of explaining the definition (or lack thereof) of the term, and its use as hype.  I think a better tactic than removing information entirely would be to move the """"ridiculous"""" groups, or those who are termed supergroups merely because of membership, not achievement, to a separate heading.  Keep """"Renowned Supergroups"""" at the top, if you like, while putting in an objective criteria for membership in this group (number of albums sold, perhaps?).  Add another heading or two for """"Other Supergroups""""; maybe even """"Failed Supergroups"""", and move the rest of the entries on the list there.

I sympathise with your desire to tidy this up, but removing information completely is seldom the answer.  \talk 23:31, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

There, I've broken it up with the groups you left on the page as """"renowned""""  expect others to move bands in and out of that section.   I'm not entirely happy with the result; I think perhaps a better structure would be to divide the list by decade  I think it might provide a clearer view of which groups have stood the test of time.  What do you think?  \talk 00:07, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)

If none of the members have pages in Wikipedia (I'm looking at you, Misery Index), then it probably isn't a supergroup.

Wow. When I last modified this page, it wasn't absurd. The average person when they end a relationship or employment will go on and find another relationship or job.

 I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (""""social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media""""), and from the license used.
 The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant.
 As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal).

I removed the following section due to its entirely being original research and speculation. Per User:SteveLoughran's request, here it is.

The implementation details of S3 are not documented, but it is possible to infer aspects of it from the behaviour (and pricing) of the service.

 There is an S3 repository in the US; there is another in Europe. Their locations are not public.
 From an EC2 server, read access can initially be slow. This could imply that S3 data is not always in the same physical location as all the EC2 servers. 
 Amazon do not bill for data transferred between the US EC2 server farm and the US S3 store, but they do for access between the servers and the European S3 store. While the S3 store and the EC2 servers may be in separate locations, they must be close enough together that cost of transferring data is neglible. Both services are presumably hosted on the same Metropolitan Area Ethernet.
 Connectivity between the S3 datastores and the rest of the Internet is good. This implies they  are close to one of the main Internet exchanges.
 After the initial slow access, later accesses are fast. This could imply that the data is cached.
 Write access is tangibly slower than writing to a local hard disk. Amazon guarantee that when the operation has completed, data has been written to disk in multiple locations. 
 Amazon warn that even after data has been written, old values may still be read. This implies that there can be more than one cache of the data, and that every GET request does not trigger a check from the front-end caches to the back-end store.
 Amazon adjusted their initial pricing from a simple flat rate per GB to one that charges small frequently retrieved items per thousand GET or HEAD operations, rather than purely per byte. There may be a flat cost for every entry (indexing, billing entries) and a per-request cost in CPU-time for every access. These fixed overheads are now billed for.

The dynamic per-bucket DNS entries are implemented by having a custom S3 DNS server that returns a hostname for every host under the s3.amazonaws.com subdomain, even if a bucket of that name has never been created: 
> nslookup made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com

Non-authoritative answer:
made-up-name-for-wikipedia.s3.amazonaws.com     canonical name = s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.
s3-directional-w.amazonaws.com  canonical name = s3-1-w.amazonaws.com.
Name:   s3-1-w.amazonaws.com
Address: 72.21.211.228

At the identified host, there is a web server that always serves up 404 error pages when a GET request against a nonexistent bucket is issued.

I agree with 100% Andrea James is a vindictive professional transsexual who will hurt any one who disagrees with her or threatens her position as the """"Dowager Empress Queen of the Transsexual Sexual Paraphernalia Society"""". Her education is a grand hoax as is her degree from the University Of Chicago. Andrea James is another transsexual who thinks because she can hide her past life she can make up any all all of her credentials with the thought or fear that no one challenge the validity of them. So you will know if I was graduate of the University of Chicago I would have my diploma displayed on my website with my transcripts if some called my education a grand hoax. Ultimately Ms. James steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the University Of Chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved? Andrea James where is the proof, lets see your degree and tran Pityscripts from the University Of Chicago.

Furthermore Andrea loves to use her web-sites as a whipping post to harm professionals reputations who will not bow to her perverted view point. With out one doubt Ms. James needs help but like a pathological liars she will fix it her self and damn the people she hurts. In a way you have to feel sorry for her, however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation. In reality what that boils down to is jealousy of the worst nature and her use vile """"Yellow Journalism"""" and evil deeds would make any sociopath proud"""". Andrea James gets an A+ for being a sociopath.

The real tragedy about Andrea James is her failure to admit when she is wrong and to keep on making the same mistake in front of every one because she thinks it will go away. Your wrong Andrea if you want respect and people to like you, than you need to learn that hurting people reputation will not make you any friends.

Hi Pterantula,

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references.  For example, the studies of the """"effects of Landmark Education"""" is from the third-party surveys.  If, instead, the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead, they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable.  (We've gone around in circles on that many times as well.)

As well, the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education (with rebuttals in many cases).

As for litigation, I am aware of five outbound cases:

Pre-emptive warning

1) Traci Hukill """"The Est of Friends"""" (1998, pre-emptive warning, no suit filed)

Actual litigation, outbound

 Elle Magazine   (1998, LE achieved no result)
 Cynthia Kisser  (1997, LE won retraction)
 Margaret Singer (1997, LE won retraction)
 Rick Ross       (2005, LE cancelled suit for product disparagement)

There are about three inbound cases (against LE):
 Stefanie Ney (court ruled in LE's favor)
 Been versus Weed (2002; 10 claims, 3 settled, 7 dropped;  LE was a cross-defendent)
 Tracy Neff (1997, sexual harrassment, settled out of court;  LE lacked a """"sexual harrassment"""" policy at the time and got pulled in on this)

Does anyone have anything more than this from LE's inception in 1991 (14 years ago)?  Litigation regarding """"est"""" should be on the """"est"""" page.   For a company with $70 million in revenue and over 800,000 customers of the Landmark Forum, this is a tiny amount of litigation.

"To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.
The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.",0

And I just wanted to mention that my mother also had a surgery in 1996 for her epilepsy and it lessened her seizures to only one a day (and at around the same time everyday). I think the surgery did wonders in improving her life. However she experienced a Sudden Unexplained Death in epilepsy in January of 1998...about two years after her surgery. I believe the surgery had nothing to do with her death (it was two years later how could it be?) and that seriously, the surgery she had really did wonders for her. She was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second. My mother's case was not hereditary. She has a very odd case. They were never sure EXACTLY what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life (well she was about 8 or 9 months old at the time of her first ever seizure) but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth. But once again, they were never sure.   03:49, 28 August 2009",0

Okay, now that that's done, you can definitely use the same reference more than once!  It's easy to do.  This is covered at Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners but I'll cover the main points here.  The first time you use a reference, it will look something like this:

You basically just re-use the first part of the reference tag again but put in the ending / character.
And you can definitely say that she is married with three children, if you have a reference.  We often tend to leave out children's names for the sake of the privacy of the child.  The names of the children of very well known celebrities are often included, for example Angelina Jolie or Gwyneth Paltrow because the kids names are already mentioned in so many news stories about them.  But someone who is not quite so famous, like Back, usually has the names left out.

 WP:OUTING 

Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently, Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

WP:PRIVACY
""""WP:OUTING"""" redirects here. For the alternate meaning of outing, as in excursion, see Wikipedia:Meetup.
For the Wikimedia privacy policy, see Wikimedia:Privacy policy.
Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. It also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username, but whose old identifying marks can still be found. Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by Oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.

The fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name, making them easily identifiable through online searches, is not an excuse for """"opposition research"""". Dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment, just as doing so regarding their past edits on other Wikipedia articles may be. However, if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted, such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. If redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the COI discussion, then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on Wikipedia: it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a COI and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.

If you see an editor post personal information about another person, do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. Doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. Do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. When reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. Outing should usually be described as """"an attempted outing"""" or similar, to make it clear that the information may or may not be true, and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.

Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly.  """,0

Johnson, who intended to symbolically sign the bill into law during the Fourth of July week, then put his signature on the law just hours after it was passed by the House of Representatives on July 2.  The Voting Rights Act was also passed due to pressure from the Selma to Montgomery marches.  In secrecy, Johnson and King had organized the marches so that they would go beyond extending voting rights and advance War on Poverty legislation.

Were Michael's mind open to rational persuasion, he would have yielded on this long before. His objection is, at this point, ideological. More examples will not convince him.  That we all get things wrong at times is easy to see. What is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong, and why we persist in error.  On the Israeli/Jewish side of this common problem, there are two elements, one cultural, one a matter of the politics of image-forging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived. I think Michael's error is to be classified in the former, which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of Jewish exceptionalism, and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise Palestinian realities that might remind one of similar Jewish realities, is repressed. Michael dislikes 'uprising' because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the Warsaw uprising. There is a deeper analogy. The Romans crushed Bar Kochba's revolt (which in the historical literature is often described as an 'uprising'), and under Hadrian set out to Romanize Judea. The creation of Israel vindicates Bar Kochba, but also, in rejudaising Palestine, creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of Bar Kochba, and the PLO/Hamas/the Al-Aqsa type violence, esp.sacred violence in the name of national restoration. This analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of Jewish exceptionalism, since those who evoke the myth of Masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory, very much as Bar Kochba himself did. Rabbinical schools after the failure of Bar Kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states, one which lasted until the creation of Israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the Book of Joshua, and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of Canaan. Ironically, what is expected of Palestinians is that they cringe before the power of Israel's occupation: any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii, or zealotism, is dismissed as an appalling 'Arab cultural trait': though in fact it resonates, mutatis mutandis, with analogies from Jewish history under the Roman empire from Titus to Hadrian, where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished. The early Zionists from Jabotinsky to Ben-Gurion to Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances.  Being thorough realists, they didn't have to kid themselves. Today we live in the fog of public opinion myths, where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness. People are raised on the standard clichés, endlessly recycled by hasbara machines, and underwrite them sincerely, because they no longer have much of a sense of history. Much could be said of this. But this is not the place.Regards",0

I am sorry to say Mr.Tosa was not invited to that championship. So what you are telling is not true. Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization. Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Were you at the championship or something? 
So, if Mr. Tosa never had any contact with Mr. Shukumine after 1962, then please explain these picturse of Mr. Tosa and Mr. Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website .  Zzaroc 22:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I am sorry I didn't say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962. I said he didn't had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine. This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa's book about Genseiryu Butokukai. And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that. 212.127.137.2 22:53, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

You don't have to be a black belt, when your good, by the way. But take your time, I am patient.
But I was wondering. Mr. Tosa published his book in 1984, but there still a picture of him together with Mr. Shukumine in 1985 (I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site). Then there are still a few questionmarks.
But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization.
There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who.
And I have got also another question. Mr. Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack. But when did he started to get ill?  Zzaroc 23:59, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort,time. And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.

I don't know when Mr. Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn't had any contact shouldn't be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date. So I apologize for that. But I heard this occured in the mid till end '80s.

No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book """"Shin Karatedo Kyohan"""" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.

I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don't like to talk about his sickness. I met Mr. Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. In Okinawa I only met him from a distance. So I am sorry I can't anwer this question for I didn't have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine.  212.127.137.2 06:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

This article seems to have improved from its first review significantly. Most problems are resolved, such as the sub-par prose, which is now very well readable. Some comments on the issues raised in the first review:
 the period dealt with spans approximately mid-2013 to September 2014. This is an indication it may not meet criterion 3a. - As far as I can see, there is not a lot more to say about this young lady so far. While taking in interest in people who are famous because of their parents and because of who they date eludes me, it is no reason to fail criterion 3a.
 Daily Mail may not be a reliable source - There are a couple of references here that could be argued do not come from what is usually considered reliable. However, it is accepted in """"tabloid"""" topics to include """"tabloid"""" sources. Otherwise, Wikipedia would only consist of articles on people The Guardian writes about. Yawn!

However, these things should be adressed:
 Nowhere does it actually state that Wright and Penn are famous actors. That is however necessary, because otherwise one might easily ask why this person deserves a Wikipedia article in the first place.
 The archive links in the references are inconsistent. The style you should use is the one in reference #1 (Link to original page, publiser, archived from and then """"the original"""" as the link). This can easily be achieved by using the cite web template.
 However the first reference is not a good example alltogether, since it makes no sense that the page is from July 28, 2014 and it is stated that it was retrieved on July 19th. Please look into this.

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

In ictu oculi
As has been explained, """"POVfork"""" is one of the ritual phrases you incant on this page; because it defies reality, it is an excuse to avoid meaningful discourse, rather than an attempt at achieving it. If you mean something else, which you likely do, then use words that are accurate and express your meaning, rather than obsessively repeating obviously false statements.
As has also been explained, repeating long lists of last names, without any context (e.g. """"Voorst, Horbury, Schafer, Berger, Maier, Meier, Theissen, Klausner, Rubenstein, Boyarin, Teppler, Stanton & Stroumsa, Kessler, Sanders, Neusner"""") are also ritual behaviors that have little semantic content. You have been challenged to produce actual citations, which would include book names, author, year, page number, and relevant quotations. You continually refuse or fail to do so.
When you finally produce a citation that more-or-less complies with WP:CITE (albeit with completely idiosyncratic formatting), you still get it wrong. For example, you just now added what you describe as """"Quarles (2008)"""". In fact, the reference is Bauckham (2008): I know this because I added it myself three weeks ago! Not only that, the material you added was already present in the article, in the very section in which I added the citation! If you do not read the article, then how can you comment on its contents, much less attempt to edit them?
I have kept your Voorst citation, and again, put it where it belongs. For the longest time, the lede had the sentence """"There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus"""", with the citation Such as Dalman This reference, of course, is one of your infamous """"last name only"""" citations, which completely fail WP:CITE. Rather than replace it with Voorst, who makes the same point, and is a century newer, you oddly repeat the material in a second sentence. There is no rational explanation for doing this that I can see.
We absolutely do have a neutral first sentence in the lede, despite your best attempts to the contrary - that was the clear consensus of the RFC above. You fixation on the claim that Yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. It has been your on-going contention that the name """"Yeshu"""" is merely the name used by rabbis for Jesus. However, when you insist that """"Yeshu"""" does not refer to an individual, or demand proof that it does, what you are also demanding is proof that """"Jesus"""" refers to an individual, since it is you that insists """"Yeshu""""=""""Jesus"""". Do you not believe Jesus was and indivudal? Are you promoting, then, the Jesus myth theory?
I am doing my best still to assume good faith here; unfortunately, to do so, I am forced to come to the conclusion that the issue with your edits and comments here is one of competence.

No, Bach's taille was essentially the same as Lully's taille [des hautbois]—a straight, flare-belled tenor oboe in F. As the Wikipedia article plainly states (citing the New Grove article by Michael Finkelman), the cor anglais only came into existence ca. 1720, """"when a bulb bell was added to the oboe da caccia"""". Sibyl Marcuse states that the name did not first start appearing in scores until """"around 1760"""". This name was indeed drawn, according to Finkelman, from an older Germann term for the the flare-belled horns played by angels in paintings of the Middle Ages—doubtless shawms of all sorts—""""engellisches Horn, meaning """"angelic horn"""". There is a distinction to be made (as Finkelman does) between the emergence of the instrument called cor anglais, and the (German) term """"angelic horn"""", loosely applied to shawms/oboes of all sorts. The French word taille (for what it is worth) is cognate with English """"tall"""", and is applied to viols (tenor viola da gamba), violins (tenor violin, or viola). The taille des hautbois'' was known in England as """"tenor hoboy"""", and Purcell scored for it in 1690, a good thirty years before the invention of the cor anglais, and seventy years before the name first appears in musical scores.

Binksternet
Hello Enric, I just had a very brief discussion with  which went as follows:

Me:   """"Binksternet, User:Kitsunedawn has inserted a new section into Amelia Earhart which is redundant to the paragraph on Gardner Island. The new section also seems to have a bit of a WP:POV issue. I’d rectify the situation myself, but the page is protected. I understand you have some history with the article so I thought you might want to know about it.""""

Binksternet:   """"The added material is far too promotional for TIGHAR. I would like to ask why you, the IP editor from Northern Mississippi, did not remove the text yourself. It is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about Earhart. Nevertheless, I am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so.""""

After I finished laughing I started to write a reply, but I realized that if Binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply.  I also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless.  I am well aware of my own location.

This is not the first time that Binksternet has started shit with me.  Back in November I had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with Binksternet when I tried to correct a problem with Grey School of Wizardry.

Binksternet indicates (in a picture) on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required.  And while he is entitled to his own opinion, he isn’t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at IP editors.

The last time I wanted to fix a problem with the Earhart article I asked Dougweller to do it, and he was agreeable.  I see now that I should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator, but I had thought it would be helpful to alert Binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn’t normally edit the article.

Would you please explain to Binksternet that:

1.  I can’t edit the article because it is protected and I have already explained that in my first post.

2.  It isn’t civil to baselessly accuse IP editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve Wikipedia and operating in good-faith.

3.  IP editors are allowed to edit Wikipedia.

 DJ Peterson 

The link you added on the DJ Peterson page is broken.  Also, the information you added is incorrect.  Zunino was drafted 3rd overall.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.16.215.84   
 I fixed the link. Also, the information was initially correct when I first added it, but a later edit made the sentence incorrect: Peterson is the highest drafted player in New Mexico Lobos history, not Mariners. 24Mati 

 Your revert of my edit on the page about Roblox 

I should have cited my other sources. Those include Youtube, and items on Roblox (decals, models)

Youtube 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJEJNoxoiIQ
Youtube 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBkDFv0WR5o
Youtube 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLy5FCJZIng
Decal 1: http://www.roblox.com/April-Fools-Smile-item?id=76579753

  
 YouTube videos are not considered reliable, as anyone can upload a video and make a claim. The Decal is also not a reliable source, since the description itself is not enough, and like YouTube, self-published sources are not considered reliable. For the hacking incident, the only way for it to be mentioned here is through either a reliable source, like a news group, or by the developers itself. I believe the game's developers have a blog, which can be accessed from the site itself, and if one of the developers wrote a blog entry about it (a passing mention is not notable), it can be added. 24Mati 

 Erm, here the blog: http://blog.roblox.com/2012/04/april-1st-site-issue-and-update/ — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Alright, thanks for providing it. While the blog does mention the eventual shutdown due to """"site issues"""", I doubt it'll be enough to be added to the article, since one who's new to Roblox and reading the page would believe it was just for routine maintenance, when it was much worse; David Baszucki didn't say exactly what the cause was, which - in the case of the videos - was various hackings, it seems, and you can't add in details that the source doesn't provide. For the most part, if you can find another blog post from the developers, or a reliable source (as I said, a news agency, for example), that actually explains what happens, then it might merit inclusion. 24Mati

 Twitter and Wikia usually are not reliable sources, especially the latter, like Wikipedia. As I had said, if you can find a reliable source, like a news agency, that discusses the hackings in detail, then it might be considered.

I don't know the poet articles you speak of, so I don't know what might be different with them, but the rule as I understand it is that poetry should be quoted only as an integrated part of the article's discussion. For example, it is not sufficient to say """"Here is a poem by Bhupi Sherchan:"""", but it might be appropriate to say """"One of the characteristics of Bhupi Sherchan's style is [such-and-such], as can be seen in these verses from [poem]:"""".

There was also another consideration, which I didn't mention in my edit reason because I thought perhaps it was too obvious: This is the English-language Wikipedia, and there is an expectation that English-language readers can read any article without missing something because it's in another language. That doesn't necessarily mean you can't quote from another language at all, but if you do it should be accompanied by a suitable translation into English.

 Re: John von Neumann 

It does not fit in with other articles in this category: 3D Life, Block cellular automaton, Cellular automaton, Cellular image processing, Codd's cellular automaton, Conway's Game of Life, Day & Night, to name but a few. Generally speaking, the CA category appears to be divided between examples of cellular automata (Immigration (CA), QuadLife, Rule 110 cellular automaton) and terms related to cellular automata (Garden of Eden pattern, Gun (CA), Oscillator (CA)) - to such an extent that it might be best to divide this category into two subcategories. What you don't find in this category, however, are people who have contributed to cellular automata, regardless of their distinction. What we can do, however - I'll be glad to contribute, and it'd be nice if you helped to - is possibly create a subcategory, """"Scientists who have made a major contribution to cellular automata"""" (or, for preference, a shorter name, if you can come up with one), and in this category place Mr von Neumann.

""""Jack Sarfatti

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Jack Sarfatti (born September 14, 1939) is a physicist, known for his Internet writings and Usenet postings explaining his theories. His reputation for holding controversial and non-mainstream views extends back to the 1970s.

Some of his wide-ranging views have included speculations of UFOs as extraterrestrials; the idea that some parapsychological phenomena are real; speculations that faster-than-light communication is possible; and most recently his design for space travel by warping spacetime in the region of the vehicle using dark energy / Josephson junction techniques, a form of """"metric engineering"""".

He also claims to have originated the idea of supersolids.""""

The above sentence should be changed to

He also claims to have originated the idea of recently observed supersolids in 1969 in the paper """"Destruction of Superflow in Unsaturated 4He Films and the Prediction of a New Crystalline Phase of 4He with Bose-Einstein Condensation"""" in Physics Letters, Vol 30A, number 5, 3,, November, 1969 p.300.

The following eminent physicists testified to this claim.

George Chapline, Jr. Lawrence Livermore Laboratory wrote on Feb 16, 2005

""""Jack, Your solid He4 superfluid paper is wonderful! You actually did something once of very great importance - and apparently you did not realize this. This paper is a precursor to quantum gravity, and much more important in that regard than string theory (you can quote me). George"""" 

David Finkelstein wrote on March 26, 2005. 

""""Dear Jack: Congratulations! What greater pleasure can a physicist have than see a long range prediction finally come true. David"""" 

In addition Leonard Susskind of Stanford University Physics Department wrote on Dec 31,2004:

""""To whom it may concern, The Glogower Susskind paper of 1963 which introduced phase operators for a quantum oscillator was in direct response to discussions between Glogower, Susskind, and Jack Sarfatti. Sarfatti's contributions were significant. The correct attribution should be to the 'Glogower, Sarfatti, Susskind' operators. Sincerely, Leonard Susskind""""

Education

Sarfatti earned an undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1960, where he wrote an honors thesis under the guidance of Hans Bethe. He went on to earn a Master's degree from UCSD in 1967, and a Ph.D. from UCR in 1969, writing a thesis under the direction of Fred Cummings. He taught at San Diego State and studied as a research fellow under David Bohm at the University of London before venturing into non-academic pursuits.

[edit]

""""Involvement with paraphysics

On 21 June 1974 Sarfatti observed alleged psychic Uri Geller, and reported that Geller demonstrated genuine """"psychoenergetic"""" ability at Birbeck beyond the doubt of any reasonable man, under relatively well-controlled and repeatable experimental conditions. (Science News, vol. 106; 20 July 1974; page 46). He later revised this opinion after discussing the matter with James Randi. He wrote in a letter, """"On the basis of further experience in the art of conjuring, I wish to retract my endorsement of Uri Geller's psychoenergetic authenticity."""" (Science News, 6 December 1975, page 355).""""

Translating Reich is problematic. The word designates a state (or group of states under one rule). If ruled by an emperor (Kaiser), it is an empire (Kaiserreich), if ruled by a king (König), it is a kingdom (Königreich). Reich cannot easily be translated when it refers to a territory that is ruled by neither an emperor nor a king; so the word has been adopted in English as a loan word. Cf.

"Since consensus was to keep, and I still felt strongly that the lack of web accessibility was a problem, I added spans into the List of R-phrases, then converted the R-phrase template to include a #link into the list, only to discover that the link target shadows the title attribute for tooltip purposes. To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.
If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article. Either way, you won't have to touch the templates.

"Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

You recently removed  a source I added to the article Modern animation in the United States.

"Link to UST Global leadership team 

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).

 A tag has been placed on True Lisbon Thugs requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

'New' articles

I'm intending to make separate articles for each class as already exist at the german wikipedia.

Main reasons are:
I didn't find half as much info as I wanted in the article - hence I want to expand them
If I expand this article for all the classes it might become very long.
I also found the non-numerical treatment of the classes a bit confusing.

Once these articles are made this article could act as a hub - (perhaps renamed """"DB V160 family"""" or similar), or the article could be deleted.

Secondly, the majority of the articles I've read and have encountered issues with need nothing more than simple corrections in grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

I apologize for missing those two sentences that you expressed concern over.  Thank you for catching them.  I also really liked your copyedits to the intro.

My reason for relying on the Straight Dope article rather than the primary sources he cites is well explained at WP:MEDRS: In general, Wikipedia's medical articles should use published reliable secondary sources whenever possible. Reliable primary sources may be used only with great care, because it's easy to misuse them. For that reason, edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a secondary source.

I am well acquainted with searching PubMed - see for example the article I wrote early pregnancy factor.  Also notice I added the citation for PMID 1287678 to the McClintock effect article.  It's not unfamiliarity with these tools that guided my addition to the article, it's a high regard for the knowledge and research done by the Straight Dope staff and a desire to use reliable secondary sources whenever they are available.

Q.  How are the barrels rotated?

A.  The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B).  The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly.  This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts.  The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum.

Q.  How long is typical spin-up time?

A.  While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft.  Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate.  Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. 

On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish.  During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur.  The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be """"water washed"""" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades.  Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.""",0

The purpose of the article should be directed towards answering the question of what the Catholic League means in American politics. That Donohue cares more about calling Democrats atheist anal sex fiends, so much that he would ally with open racists and actual anti-Catholics to do so, than he does about promoting what many others consider to be mainstream Catholic values is very relevant to why Donohue is important and worthy of an article here.",0

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""? I don't think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of, but I don't like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss. Thank you for the civil reply.

"Request for reconsideration:  Deletion of Bullshido.net entry 

Requesting you re-examine the arguments in [], as per WP:DRV.

Your summary of my argument is factually false.  My argument was that the addition of four [more [reliable sources should carry weight.  The statement that the Real Fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts.  Also, you gave us no time whatever to contact Sean Treanor and learn more from him; in any case, an article hosted on Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism webpage, and not on a student's personal website within stanford.edu, could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision.

Furthermore, regarding the Real Fighter article, , the President of the American Sambo Association, took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got produced:

My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.

This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.

The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus.  If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.

I respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points, and ask you to reconsider.",0

"About the Sum 41 edits 

I think the way you did it that it goes with two chronologies (studio and non-studio albums), it is very confusing, and I haven't come across any band, and this goes for bands with even more albums and EPs, to have such a split chronology between studio and non-studio albums. I think it'll be for the best if there will be one chronology with all the studio albums, live, EPs, etc. like most bands, its less confusing that way.

Likewise, Catt's """"electromagnetism"""" does not pass muster. """"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)"""" throws up quite enough problems. Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only """"real science"""" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since """"displacement current"""" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing """"displacement current"""" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. Catt has quoted Davidson as (in effect) calling the Telegrapher's Equations """"absurd"""" because they model a TL as a capacitor, when Catt & Davidson know that a capacitor is a TL. [Electromagnetics ch6]. Although Catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the TL are based on experiment they are, in fact, derived from the Telegrapher's Equations in the first place.

Since it appears that you have escalated your case to ArbCom, there is really no point in echoing your arguments on your talk page in this way.  You should offer any further information directly and exclusively to ArbCom via e-mail.  If they decide to believe you and reinstate your account, you can share the news here with the rest of us at that time.

Also, previously, I offered you some very concrete suggestions for establishing who you are (as opposed to making claims of who you are not).  If you are not in fact """"Justice Forever"""" and are serious about wanting to convince ArbCom of this fact, I would strongly recommend you follow those suggestions ASAP.  Your latest piece of """"new evidence"""" is really about the same as trying to clear your name via a checkuser request — something which, as you should already understand, is almost never accepted as a way of disproving sockpuppet allegations, and which in fact is more often taken as evidence that you are a sock trying to blow smoke in people's faces.  Unless you present your most convincing information to ArbCom right now, you are likely to find them unwilling to listen to anything further you might have to say, regardless of its merits.

I'm going to stop watching your talk page at this point.  If you are a sock of """"Justice Forever"""", you're wasting my time — and if you are not """"Justice Forever"""", I may be wasting your time by making you feel there is a reason to continue arguing your case here (and in this particular way) rather than talking only to ArbCom and trying to make the kind of case with them that has a chance (though I don't know how much of a chance) of actually working.

"""COUNTERTERRERISM POLICY STRONG WORDS ==

This is the point where the nonmuslims invite the wrath of All muslims

Nonmuslim nations are weaping about terrorism and they are giving wind to the fire in muslim hearts burnt due to these type of PICTURES displayed on the sacred Artical of Muhammad (PBUH). The day is near when muslims will take revenge. From the history we have seen that ARABS and NONARABS have slayed their children in the name of ALLAH nad MUHAMMAD. So if the writer of this artical MUHAMMAD and the pictures includer thinks that he is giving a good idea of getting knowledge, he/she is obviously on wrong path. Respect to get Respect, more over LIVE AND LET LIVE (basic peaceful Muslims psycology). There is a need of education among Nonmuslim nations especially cristians who have no path to live, in tension they are running here and there to get shelter but, let us see in next 2 decades they are building such a mountain for them which they cant handle. THE Discussion is to long and i have lot more points, i dont want any one to opt the orders but to """"DO LISTEN"""" and think a way out.

SO PLEASE DO NOT CREAT PROBLEMS FOR YOUR SELF. """"IF NATIONS LIKE ARAB SOUTH ASIA WILL COME TO KNOW ABOUT THESE PICTURES ABOUT WHICH MOST OF MUSLIMS ARE UNAWARE THERE WILL BE A VERY BIG PROBLEM"""".

If USA, Allies want Pakistan to become what they think then make islam happy Pakistan will get into there clutch. more over the point to restore peace in AFGANISTAN AND IRAG the common man in pakistan is more intelligent than the think tank in USA. since i have been to lot more places i think that policy needs to be completely revived i dont want the powerful nation to enforce a world wide civil wars and revolutions. In Muslims there is nothing except Faith in ISLAM. They always unite in time of need and the internal hot talk in every streat of pakitan is integration of all the sects and nations named muslim

looking forward in anitcipation.

Remove these Pictures and become safe please do not get on to the war and kill and get Killed in the hand of muslims and let us become your friends.Muslims have Faith in JIHAD nonmuslims has no term like that as basic piller of religion. One way what i propose is very safe...

"On inspection, the references to '1996' in the 'Jim Bell' article are not footnoted.  (And, they never have been, since Skomorokh added them 2 years ago).  The AP essay was begun about April 1995, and eventually grew to include 10 parts.  The first 7 parts were written in 1995, and were published immediately as they were written.  Part 8 was a copy of an article by a journalist, Paul Maxwell, writing in the Asahi Evening News (English language newspaper in Japan).   It and parts 9 and 10 were written about February 1996.  You can be sure that by July 1995, 'the Feds' were well aware of the content of the (then-growing) AP essay. The Feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the AP article:  One technique they used, when the applied for a warrant, was for the affiant to claim something like, 'I first became aware of the AP essay on....'   That specific affiant ['affidavit writer' for you who don't know the law] may very well have 'first become aware' on some late date, but that doesn't mean that other Feds weren't aware, months or well over a year before.  It served the purposes of the Feds to make it appear not merely that the AP essay was written far closer to Bell's May 1997 arrest, but also to conceal the fact of their agent Walsh/Wilson's involvement perhaps one year prior to Bell's first attendance of MCCLC meetings.  Why?   It sounds much more like an 'emergency' if something happened yesterday, or last week:  They certainly wouldn't have wanted to have to tell the judge, 'Well, Bell wrote this TERRIBLE essay...two years ago' !!!
This explains, I believe, why Skomorokh claimed the AP essay was written in '1996', and furthermore gave no references. '1996' (at least, December 1996) sounds reasonably close to early 1997.  'April 1995', on the other hand, sounds like an eternity from May 1997, the month Bell was arrested.  71.36.117.224",0

Thanks! Your copyedits are much appreciated, as is the advice. To reply to your points:
I was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit, although I want to make sure to keep enough of it in. Especially in Szigeti on the Violin, he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing, which (in my opinion)is very important for his biography. That said, I will try trimming it down.
Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere. 
I had a good laugh at your remark about how I should get academic credit for this, especially because just a few days ago, my obnoxious Music History professor bellowed """"Don't ever look up anything on Wikipedia if you expect to stay in this class!

Sorry to take so long in replying, I've only had a small amount of WP time the last few days.  I see the point you are making, on the other hand it seems useful to say something about General Haftar's character given such a reputable source says something about it after consulting 20-odd people - which given FT's reputation you would think is a balanced representation of his contacts, but they do not say who they were. I agree the FT quote """"wasn’t well informed in politics"""" is very surprising given his position. I'm happy with you removing this, and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info.  FT registration is no-cost for a few articles a month, but here is a wider quote of what they said:

Even supporters acknowledge his political ambitions, suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country’s liberals. The armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the Gaddafi-era military he repeatedly turned against; the Islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the 2011 uprising. Many wonder whether he is a committed democrat, as he claims, or just another Arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions, in the mould of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syria’s Hafez Assad and Gaddafi.You need someone tough like Haftar to step up to the outlaws,” says the commentator Abdel Hamid el-Jadi. “He has experience in the Libyan military and he knows the tribes. If he has political ambitions we’ll deal with that in the second stage.”

But others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. Of nearly two- dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the Financial Times, none could identify any of his interests outside war. In meetings with exiled opposition groups in the US and Africa, before he returned to serve as the rebel army’s chief of staff in the 2011 uprising, he spoke only of his military expertise. “He wasn’t well informed in politics, relationships between countries or cultures,” said one Gaddafi-era opposition activist.Many Libyans and international experts fear the offensive that Mr Haftar is co-ordinating could further destabilise the country. In televised appearances, he has a habit of conflating the Islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, and with al-Qaeda.''

"""= Sample of bona fide sources demonstrating, or referring to, official US recognition of Scientology as a religion ===

Here is how the New York Times commented on the 1993 tax exemption: 

The landmark reversal shocked tax experts and saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes. More significantly, the decision was an invaluable public relations tool in Scientology's worldwide campaign for acceptance as a mainstream religion. On the basis of the I.R.S. ruling, the State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists. The German Government regards the organization as a business, not a tax-exempt religion, the very position maintained for 25 years by the American Government. 

I think the NY Times writer clearly expresses the view here that the US abandoned their earlier view of Scientology as a business, as still espoused today by Germany. 

Note that the State Department Report referred to in the NY Times article is the """"Religious Freedom Report."""" The Religious Freedom Reports for Germany have discussed discrimination against Scientologists by the German state almost every year since the IRS decision, referring in 2006 for example to """"certain religious minorities, notably Scientologists"""". 

Following the 1993 IRS decision, the IRS wrote to foreign governments, appending a document entitled """"Description of the Scientology Religion"""" to their letter and stating that various Scientology organizations had demonstrated that """"they were organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and that no part of their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private individual."""" 

Media references to the """"Scientology religion"""" (and similar references to Scientology as a religion) are common. 

The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties says that """"Despite its legal setbacks, Scientology has achieved full legal recognition as a religious denomination in the United States."""" 

As for the claimed inability of any governmental entity in the United States to determine what is or is not a religion, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, stated in a 1992 decision that """"Indeed, the IRS itself has stipulated in other cases that the Church of Scientology is a bona fide religion.""""; so in the view of that court at least, the IRS has been quite capable of making such stipulations. 

The St. Petersburg Times wrote in 1998 that """"After a 40-year battle, the IRS dropped its tax dispute with Scientology and declared it a tax exempt religion in 1993."""" 

Such sources cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand as Scientologist """"misrepresentation"""". 466

This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is """"something that can be demonstrated to be true"""", in other words, """"something based on empirical evidence"""". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect.

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

 Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, ''' 

Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18

A number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up on
Oct 18:

 The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations
 The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work). 
 The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation
 The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced 
 A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. 

User Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. 
This is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistently
encouraged. 

Please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them by
putting in extensive work instead of just a revert. 

I am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has 
far better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please give
your reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit''' the text 
to merge the elements you don't agree with.   It does not make sense to keep
the older inferior version that people are working with still.   

Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I'll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  

p.s. We don't need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that """"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,"""" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  

I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called """"stable"""" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,
and of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don't mind others """"ruthlessly"""" editing your text. 
As for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:

His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz",0

Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided.

There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.

Some of the sections/articles on Kambojas, as being edited and altered by Debachmann, are getting utterly confusing and more messier, and, I'm afraid, may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers.

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 Senior Editors' Observation needed 

I appeal attention of Senior editors from the globe to maintain the accountability of this page.

There have been many poor citations that are being used for cheap link building purposes and self-promotions.

Wiki user  is proven as doing vandalism here with inclusion of dead/non-existing & poor citations. He is including blogspot blogs also as references. 

 should know the following:

 Anyone can create a Blogspot blog and write this or that for years. If we start to give value to Blogspot blogs(that too not blogs of renown people) - then Wikipedia will be spammed by Blogspot blog links.
 No reference should be served as self promotion that is not relevant to Irom Charmila.
 What is """"Save Irom Sharmila Campaign""""? Where it is?? What they have done??? Do they have any valid citation of their instead of their own blog? If not then why they should be promoted?

Hence I appeal attention to prevent vandalism on this page.

 Nomers 

Nomers (Naa-mERs) are a species of pac man-like creatures that have not been discovered yet. They live on the island nomland (not to be confused with nomtopia) which has also not been discovered. They eat most plants (including the poisonous ones) and often enrage farmers (in other words, everybody living on the island of nomland) by stealing and eating their crops. Nomers can be dangerous but are mostly non-violent. If tamed and trained, Nomers can be very loyal. They would die before seeing their """"partner"""" (they insist on calling their person a partner rather than a master) meet their death. Nomers are extremely intelligent creatures and I strongly suggest those having trouble with Nomers to get a garden gnome. If you wish to buy a trained and tamed Nomer, here are some phone numbers you might consider trying:
617-nom-shtr (shtr= shelter)

However, regarding the latest addition: """"According to [[Tibetan Government in Exile]], [[Chogyal Phagpa]], the head of the [[Sakyapa]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], became the religious instructor of Kublai Khan. In exchange, Chogyal Phagpa received the support of Kublai Khan and assumed political power over the three provinces or cholkas of Tibet.[http://www.tibet.com/status/3kings.html The Three Dharma Kings of Tibet] This intereaction called priest-patron (in [[tibetan]] chöyön) relation was the first in history of Tibet and was also developped under afterward circonstances[[Tibetan sovereignty debate]]."""" I wanted to query two things.

First, the Amdo article is about the Amdo region, not Tibet, and not the """"sovereignty debate"""". While I can see how the relations with the Mongols can be relevant, since the Mongols first incorporated Amdo into other commandaries/provinces, I don't think we need too much detail on the relations between the Mongols and Tibet - that is dealt with in other articles. Furthermore, it is bad form to use internal reference: i.e. another Wikipedia article cannot be used as a reference. Finally, this statement presents only one point of view when clearly there are several. I don't want the History section of Amdo to turn into a rehash of either History of Tibet or Tibet sovereignty debate.

I propose to cut the added paragraph to """", a relationship which the Tibetan Government-in-Exile now terms a """"patron-priest relationship"""" whereby Tibet exchanged political control for the power of religious instruction of the Khans.[ref]"""".

Disgusted
No word can better describe how I feel about Wikipedia right now than """"disgusted"""".  I have deactivated all of my tools and bot tasks indefinitely, until such time that I decide how I'd like to proceed.  | yak _ 
Scotty, you are a great asset to wikipedia, and it would be a very large negative if you left,   
I agree fully!   
Concur.   
As do I. I appreciate that we haven't always got on, mostly in  rather than unofficial capacity, but as my comment on Drmies talkpage makes clear, I consider you one hell of an editor. I don't want to see you mocked or belittled for the sterling work you do, and I certainly don't want to see you leave.   
Scotty, I don't want to see you leave either, but what you said (about """"my entire existence"""") belittles my contributions in an unacceptable manner. I got fucking blocked for responding to your sneer, so eating some crow on your part is no more than fair, it seems to me.   
Drmies, come on. You guys just got blocked (and unblocked) for going at each other. Is it really necessary to keep poking? You both think you were justified, you both think the other wasn't, lets just let this die before it flares up again for round two.   
Fluffernutter, I don't think this needs mediation, thanks. Scotty is a big boy and so am I. We disagree over something, and we could have handled that very well, I suppose, until someone came in between and started throwing blocks about. Scotty, I'm sorry for what I said: you hurt my feelings and I let it be known. I'm not going to come back here since I don't want to bother you; you can always drop me a line on my talk page and you're welcome to leave a TB template as well, pace DNTR. Take it easy,   

Taking occasional breaks is healthy and encouraged. Just don't be a fucking diva about it, please. Editors have placed trust in you to be a reliable bot operator and tool maker.   
 Suggestion: replace that second sentence with """"But remember, """" for intended effect and best results.   
Believe me Scotty I know how you feel. I fell into the same trap this time last year for a much less and never recovered and I know you are familiar with that whole kerfuffle. I have gotten to the point now where I rarely edit article here anymore. The only difference is that I wasn't an admin. I hope you don't completely give up on this place like I did! I'm also glad someone had the good sense to undo the block.

Man, San Francisco is full of homeless vagrants, as is Portland, Oregon.  Fact of the matter is there is a HUGE homeless encampment by the PDX Portland Airport.  There are loads of folks living out of their cars nowadays, or in friend's cars.  The term hobo applies to these folks today facing such hard times, going city to city by train, hitchhike, etc.

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

I'll have a think about this.  Some of it amounts to, hmm, not a basic civility, but an outright encouragement.  I'd like to take that up.  Sometimes, however, a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors.  I think a Comments with a lapse is better for the first type.  I'm still sticking with Decline for the second type.
A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.

"“Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” This is a claim of consensus claim. I see no source which is defining a consensus. What these sources are saying is their own view only. A source defining a consensus would be saying something like “Most people think Kurmis are S*****”. There is no such source. Besides that, the sentence in the article is immensely confusing. It does not spell out who regards Kurmis as S*****. That should be clear. Who? Indians? Certinly not. Martians? Are you serious? Americans? Most of them won’t happen to know what is “Kurmi”. Who else? Academics? Where do we have a source saying that? Showing ten sources that talk about Kurmis as S***** and concluding on our own that they are generally regarded as X won’t do. That is synthesis/OR. Then we have to guard against cherry picking too (as Nameisnotimportant has been indicating)(cherry picking is one of the major pitfalls of using GBooks). Even if we do find a non cherry picked clear statement, we will have to see if the statement is encyclopedic enough. That would mean, we need to find the same statement in another encyclopedia to say the same thing in the same way, i.e. near the top of the article. I don’t really think this can be done by these sources (or any other sources). IMO the statement is best scrapped and replaced by something like “Recognition:Recognized by GOI as OBC”. It makes no sense to say “Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” because they are not S*****. ASAT. I am glad that we now have some fresh users on the talk page and agree that their presence and their suggestions have helped let the discussion take a positive and meaningful turn. We have quotes on the page now, some degree of  willingness to discuss things in a meaningful manner. As I have been saying, if we want to keep the present sentence, we have to come up with a clear, non cherry picked, encyclopedic quote defining a consensus. We don’t have it IMO. There may be other considerations too, and I may bring them up if necessary. I would suggest that the sentence be changed.-",0

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku Demographics of Azerbaijan, History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

From what i see the school has been and is currently being investigated by the GMC.  Should the GMC find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed, and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away.  Portraying the situation as constantly negative helps no one at all.

A barnstar: you deserve it
  The Anti-Vandalism Barnstar You've beat me to reverting vandals several times tonight, and when I took a look, I couldn't help but notice the sheer volume of vandalism patrol you've been doing. I think all your hard work deserves a barnstar!   

 David Bielkheden 

Why did you revert the last few changes to David Bielkheden article?
Seemed right to me.   
My mistake, I've rectified it and left a note on the IP's talk.   

 Emile Durkheim 

Why have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheim's page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide?  This is a productive edit, as many editions/translations refer to only one term and not the other.  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.246.234.74   
It's redundant. Egotistic- and egotistical-suicide are the same thing.   
That is the point to stating that it is """"also known as"""" the other term.  The words are not the same: egoistic refers more to a general self-centered nature while egotistical refers more to a self-centered way of thinking and speaking.  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms.  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheim's theory is significant.  This information - a matter of 5 words - should be included in Wikipedia's article.  Both are valid terms with different implications.  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing.
According Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary they're the same words. 'He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons', same thing.   
Unless that was a typo, you just used exactly the same word twice.  The difference is between EGOISTIC (one 'T') and EGOTISTICAL (two 'T's).  Look up the two words in Merriam-Webster.  —Preceding [[Wik",0

 What about the Hillman Minx? 

I don't see """"Minx"""" as an adjective. It's a noun. Using it to describe a cat seems redundant (""""she's a minx"""" means something like """"she's catty,"""" I thought  """"a minx"""" is some sort of fighting feline). 

The Hillman Minx car, in the 1950's, was a very small automobile (smaller than a Volkswagen beetle) its name probably meant to suggest that it was sprightly and energetic despite its tiny size and low power (I only know of it that our family owned two of them  a grey one with yellow ear-flaps, and later a red one  the Minx could not go fast, so its driver had to outwit other cars rather than overtaking them...).

Things are not this simple. There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy, since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian, candidates were banned from recent elections, there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place. Also Iraq's status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi'a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr's political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it's not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011",0

After that happened 'Kevin Breitenstein' came along and reverted my revert, putting the incest comment back on the page. I then visited ChicosBailBonds page only to find the opening sentence, MY NAME's KEVIN... they are one and the same... they are interested in INCEST and I have been blocked for a week by AmiDaniel for removing the foul natured jibe. I have left a note on AmiDaniel's page and she has ignored it. I have heard nothing. I think I's make better and more thorough admin than that. Unless Kevin is all 3 IDs.

I dismiss your RfC
I dismiss your RfC as nothing but harassment pure and simple. Why do you hate religion? Am I not allowed to edit on Wikipedia because I am not a radical secularist? I point out that your stereotypes about Evangelicals don't apply to everyone, and what do you do, you remove it? Am I supposed to stop being an Orthodox Catholic to edit Wikipedia? Or do you have to be a committed atheist to be """"credible""""? It seems that you aren't interested in discussing the issues from an uninvolved third-person perspective, but instead it seems you use Wikipedia to grind an axe against Christianity.
How can you say that the crop of articles your work on are neutral, when there are many inaccuracies and stereotypes, etc. about politically active Christians found within? 
Christian Reconstructionism is an outgrowth of Calvinist theology, plain an simple. How can you say that I am POV pushing
Does NPOV equal secular Leftism? The Dominionism article is heavily slanted to the Left politically, and I haven't violated any rules by posting a POV tag there. Much of what I have read form people such as Yurica, Bokaer, etc., is nothing but guilt by association.
The edit warring has come from your side from the beginning. Chip Berlet is a political operative who isn't schooled in theology, and his observations paint with a broad brush, lacking historical insights into Christian views on Church and State. This isn't a personal attack. There shouldn't be a pro- or an anti-Dominionist bias. Your stated commitment to paint """"Dominionism"""" as a threat is hardly NPOV.

"Expertise? I hope you're not suggesting I've become the go-to admin for topic  bans? Dreadful fate. Either AN or ANI would work. Theoretically, community topic ban proposals are supposed to go on AN, because they're not about one incident, and because AN isn't archived as quickly.

"Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.

So let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.

Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.

The 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.
The 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.

So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%
And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%

So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.

Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.

Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.",0

Hi Curritocurrito, thanks for your post at WikiProject Forestry. If you could elaborate a little more either there or at Talk:Dipterocarpaceae about what specific additions you might suggest for that article, that would be helpful. Thanks,   
Thanks for your reply. I suggest that you add your questions  """"why are they important? what habitat are they living? what animals eat their seeds? are they important economically? what minerals or grounds they need?""""  to the Talk:Dipterocarpaceae page. That will help others think about how they might contribute to that article.

If anyone is interested in editing these pages and needs access to primary sources - I have a reasonable collection of papers (mainly for SE Asia) and can send pdfs.
RE: the questions raised above
are they important economically? - they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia. I don't have figures for what % of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need?- variable - there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation. Some species only occur in Peatswamps, other in poor sand soils i.e. heath forests, others on rich clay soils.
what animals eat their seeds? - when they fruit, which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x (2-16) years in some of the Borneo species - they are an important food source.

 I need an advocate and help with mediation 

Greetings,

I need an advocate who will walk me through the mediation process.

I am trying to get the following added to the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Max Tegark is a renown physicist and a PhD profressor of cosmology at MIT.  He agrees with my addition.

I am having problem with an editor by the name of Lethe who follows me around Wikipedia reverting all my edits without commentary.

I have tried reasoning with him on discussion pages, but he refuses to read what I write.

Advantages of MWI

If Hugh Everett's theory was just another interpretation of Quantum Mechanics it would have no followers, especially since it proposes the existence of countless other universes which theoretically can never be observed. Because it is not falsifiable it seemingly violates Popper's criteria for a good scientific theory. The reason it has so many adherents is because it offers numerous advantages over the Copenhagen Interpretation, among which are the following:

1. Quantum mechanics becomes a deterministic theory making it more compatible with the theory of relativity and all other physics theory to date which are all deterministic. The Copenhagen Interpretation introduced indeterminacy and randomness into science. Aside from the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics there is no scientific theory that includes indeterminacy or randomness. Einstein particularly objected to this aspect of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In response to it, he said, """"God does not play dice with the universe.""""

2. It eliminates the """"measurement problem.""""

3. It eliminates Von Neumann's """"boundary problem"""": where to draw the line between the micro world where quantum mechanics applies, and the macro world where it does not. Shortly before his death in 1953, Albert Einstein wrote: """"Like the moon has a definite position whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects.""""

4. It eliminates the special place for an observer and human consciousness.

5. It restores objective reality of the universe between measurements. Shortly before his death, Albert Einstein also wrote: """"Observation cannot CREATE an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the possibility of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.""""

6. The wave-particle duality paradox evaporates. It simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. Richard Feynman said, """"[the double-slit experiment] has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality it contains the only mystery."""" David Deutcsh wrote: """". . . the argument for the many worlds was won with the double-slit experiment.""""

7. Schrodinger's Cat paradox evaporates.

It seems Einstein's main objections with quantum mechanics had more to do with the Copenhagen Interpretation, than with quantum mechanics itself. While MWI does not quite generate the kinds of worlds necessary to justify the anthropic principle, it is a step on the way to Stephen Hawking's No Boundary Proposal and Max Tegmark's All Universe Hypothesis which do justify the anthropic principle.

 Not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer 

All three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death (the film Occupation 101, The Guardian, and Time) state that she was killed by a bulldozer, whether you want to call it an accident or not. Trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed, such as """"debris"""" falling from the bulldozer, as the IDF reworded it, is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the IDF from having any direct responsibility for the action. None of the three sources state it was caused by """"debris."""" So the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught """"underneath."""" Currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. Therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. The part about the IDF referencing """"debris"""" should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence, but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. 

Here is what they do say:

1. http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/occupation-101-full-movie-in-11-parts/  Part 6 of 7 after about 7:41, the film Occupation 101 (2006) states """"she got caught underneath the bulldozer""""; """"When Rachel Corrie was killed, she was protecting a doctor's home""""; """"The U.S. Congress has refused her parents' request for an independent investigation in her murder.""""  This source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. 

2. """"Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions."""" -The Guardian. This newspaper simply states she was """"crushed to death by the bulldozer.""""

3. """"Rachel Corrie was a 23-year-old American from Olympia, Wash., who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16, 2003. Corrie was in the Gaza Strip, working with the International Solidarity Movement, which opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished. She was kneeling in front of a home, acting as a human shield, when she was bulldozed."""" - Time.     
Again, here we are told she was """"crushed to death"""" and """"bulldozed."""" Nothing about debris accidentally falling.

I or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. How exactly it killed her (whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her) is speculative. None of the three sources reference debris. If the IDF """"debris"""" statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. The IDF operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.

I'd feel better if it said something like: 

""""She was crushed by a bulldozer's operations clearing land in front of a Palestinian doctor's home.[1,2,3] An IDF investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.[source??]""""

(More accurate for the IDF part of it would be """"by debris falling from the bulldozer."""" I'd probably rather it say the IDF """"claimed"""" rather than """"reported"""" but I'm not going to change that part.)

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph 200km/h confirmed. Otherwise unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.

I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: 

""""A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""

For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.

Listen to me very carefully. Beauty may fade, but dumb is forever.  """,0

 Dithering here... 

I'm sorry we haven't met sooner.  There is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with.  His name is User:TharkunColl, an Anglo-Saxonist.  English traditionalists (even the pro-Celtic, pro-Roman) are apparently the bane of the British Isles here at Wikipedia, but I don't know about that in real life, considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant.  Yes, it's said to be more accepting than the """"proud Teutonic"""" approach to English identification, although it seems as though the Celtofascists here are trying to spin the English alone as """"foreign"""" to the Isles, even though it is easy to discover the Celtic origins in Roman Europe, especially the Brythonic kind (as much as Anglo-Saxon European ties are to the post-Classical Rome of Charlemagne and other Holy Roman """"Germanics"""").  They think that pro-Celtic, pro-Roman means hostile cultural appropriation, as they have identified you as """"the other"""", the big pink elephant in the room.  It is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile, """"mutual-exclusionary"""" factions of Celt, Roman and German, for most """"people"""" involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another, but hardly any singular Romanists, I'm afraid.  Perhaps I should try that.  Imagine the double-whammy of negativity from the """"Celto-Germanicists"""".  Ahh...there's no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed, it seems.

Incidentally, if you'd like to get worked up elsewhere, go check out the archives of that talk page...here, for instance.  In that article, it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the Greeks bestowed the name """"British Isles"""" upon that set of islands off of Gaul and that is the ultimate origin, as they instead focus exclusively upon the Tudor-Stuart settlement (extreme violation of WP:WEIGHT and barely even narrowly WP:SYNTH, so wrapped up in violations of WP:NOR!) which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect (nor do they care to see that Roman Britain was only that part of Albion, that part of the BI in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by Rome, even as Erin would go free...not contradicting the fact that they are both """"British"""", whatever that originally meant aside from the Trojan story).  Just about any and all BI related pages are vicious black holes and often, the only way to go about it, is by using extreme caution and wisdom.  You will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish, their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don't fit their profile, then """"you are wrong"""", not just what you happen to do or write, it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works.  Many times, after selecting a target, they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough, they will have provoked thee into becoming banned, just to see you squirm, as they do whatever it is they wish, to put the spin on this or that subject, according to their absolutist truisms.  Of course, you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won't even bother to level the playing field for you, only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery.  They will, most likely, base their complaints upon """"improper procedures"""", which is Orwellian codespeak for """"we don't like what he stands for, let's overwhelm him in numbers"""".

All said, it is very nice to meet you...you, like me, with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving, would probably enjoy this a lot.  I've been a fan for the longest time, of you, TharkunColl,   """,0

"I think Serven made an error on the patent numbers, then.

The citation you removed is the US Patent Office Database  there's no way to link directly to an individual patent there, which is the reason I cited the database and included information in the footnote about how to see the patent itself. Take a look at #138  it isn't issued to Colt, it has nothing to do with guns, and it was issued in the wrong year. Then take a look at X9430: for a revolver, issued to S. Colt on Feb. 25, 1836. (For both of those, you have to enter the number of the patent you want to see, then click the option to see images  there are no transcriptions, but they have scans of the original documents.)

The link I gave above  X-Patent  discusses the patents that were destroyed. Prior to 1837 (and the fire that destroyed the patent office's copies of those first patents) patents weren't numbered. After the fire, in 1837, the Patent Office started numbering all new patents, beginning at 1. They also started trying to recover extant copies of old patents, and numbering them as they found them, but beginning with X1. So pre-fire (1836 and earlier) patents are X-series, post-fire patents don't have the X. The patent Colt was issued in 1836 was an X-series patent, because it was issued before the fire. Anything without an 'X' can't be the right patent number for that date.

When sources conflict, we need to go with the primary sources above secondary sources. And the actual scans maintained by the Patent Office are about as primary as we can get on this issue.",0

 ban or block? 

As I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans """"from above"""" can't be lifted by admins. Again, this is only how I understand it, others will have their own opinions to be sure. Cheers,  """,0
"2012 suburban service reduction 

The May 2012 timetable brought a reduction in the stopping service between Marylebone and High Wycombe/Princes Risborough, with the result that stations such as Denham currently only have one train per hour in each direction off-peak, where previously they had two. In the midst of the mid- and long-distance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article, I feel this ought to be commented upon. At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration – in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181",0

Pardon me if I make a mistake here (I haven't had breakfast and I'm about to go out).

By now I've written (or rewritten) most of the """"People's Park"""" article.  I was there from the beginning because Jon Read, my former employer, was the landscape architect responsible for the park's initial design.  He also provided the tools to build it and donated many of the materials. 

That first weekend was terrific!  I drove my truck (the one pictured in the """"Hippie: Travel"""" section) up to the site and parked it in the middle of the park as it developed around me.  My good friend David Garthwaite convinced his sister, Terry, that they should play music, so """"The Joy of Cooking"""" jammed all day. I cooked food for the crowd in my truck and worked laying sod.  Returned home at the end of the weekend, tired and happy.

When they fenced off the park, my truck was still parked in """"The Boneyard""""a place at 5th and Delaware in Berkeley where a number of people were building boats, vans and so on.  My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.  Walking home after this gathering, we were assaulted by National Guard troops.  That night I defied the curfew and drove my truck all around Berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark, and it was obviously a """"hippie truck""""yet they never stopped me, even at the roadblocks, which I ignored.

Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist. Born in the Philippines, and raised in the United States from the age of 12, he was part of The Washington Post team... etc.  /talk """,0

Re Qazakh
Dear Khoikhoi, thanks for your mediation effort on this one. I agree to the general spirit of text you posted. But I would like to hightlight some corrections/additions, which I highlighted in bold below:
1. Under the Russian Empire, the rayon was an north-eastern part of the Kazakh uyezd of the Elisavetpol guberniya.
2. User:Aivazovsky needs to cite the references where he got the figures 39% Armenians and 57% Azerbaijanis from.
3. This sentence does not reflect the historical reality:
""""After the British left and more fighting between Armenians and Azeris ensued, Bolshevik forces gained control of the region and annexed it to the Soviet Union""""
Britons have left Caucasus in 1919, while Bolsheviks took over Azerbaijan (first in Caucasus) on April 28, 1920, Armenia was taken by Bolsheviks in November 1920. Soviet Union was created in 1922. So obviously Bosheviks could not have annexed it to the Soviet Union. Kazakh uyezd was part of Azerbaijan (Elisavetpol governorate was designated so by Britons), which under Bolshevik rule was divided between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
4. """"Neither country has disputed this boundary since"""" quote is not true. Armenia occupied one of the exclaves of Kazakh rayon, called Yuxari Askipara during 1991-1994 active phase of war.  """,0

The term """"Occam's razor"""" first appeared in 1852 in the works of Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), long after Ockham's death circa 1349. Ockham did not invent the razor, so its association with him may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it (Ariew 1976). And though he stated the principle in various ways, the most popular version was written not by himself but by John Ponce of Cork in 1639 (Thorburn 1918).""""

 DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)   

DIFFUSION ASSOCIATED NEOCLASSICAL INDIGENOUS SYSTEM OF HALL ASSEMBLY (DANISHA)

Dr. A.B.Rajib Hazarika, PhD, MIAMP(Germany),FRAS(Lond.),MWASET,A.E.S.
Lecturer, Dept. of Mathematics,
Diphu Govt. College, Diphu
Assam, India
The present study is related different geometry of the Hall thrusters in which I have tried to get better results than the simple Hall thrusters available at present with the future next generation device Duo Triad Tokomak collider (DTTC) hub by the using new type of code Diffusion Associated Neoclassical Indigenous Hall Assembly (DANISHA).
Hall thrusters were studied independently in the US and the USSR in the 1950s and '60s. However, the concept of a Hall thruster was only developed into an efficient propulsion device in the former Soviet Union, whereas in the US, scientists focused instead on developing girded ion thruster. Two types of Hall thrusters were developed in the Soviet Union:
(A)Thruster with wide acceleration zone, SPD (Russian), SPT, (Stationary Plasma Thruster) at Design Bureau Fake. 
(B) Thruster with narrow acceleration zone, DAS in English: TAL, (Thruster with Anode Layer), at the Central Research Institute for Machine Building (TsNIIMASH). 
 
 
Soviet and Russian SPD thrusters
The common SPD design was largely the work of A. I. Morozov. SPD engines were operated since 1972. They were mainly used for satellite stabilization in North-South and in East-West directions. Since then until the late 1990s 118 SPD engines completed their mission and some 50 continued to be operated. Thrust of the first generation of SPD engines, SPD-50 and SPD-60 was 20 and 30 mN respectively. In 1982 SPD-70 and SPD-100 were introduced, their thrust being 40 mN and 83 mN. In the post-Soviet Russia high-power (a few kilowatts) SPD-140, SPD-160, SPD-180, T-160 and low-power (less than 500 W) SPD-35 were introduced. SPT-100 has a life time of 8000 hrs, efficiency of 52%.Soviet and Russian DAS-type engines include D-38 and D-55. 
Soviet-built thrusters were introduced to the West in 1992 after a team of electric propulsion specialists, under the support of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, visited Soviet laboratories and experimentally evaluated the SPD-100 (i.e., a 100 mm diameter SPT thruster). Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. They were used mainly for station keeping and small orbital corrections. Currently Hall Thruster research, design, and theoretical modeling are led by experts at NASA Glenn Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as Aerojet and Busek Co.
This technology was used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 and is used on a number of commercial geostationary satellites. 
What's a Hall Thruster?    The Hall thruster is a type of plasma-based propulsion systems for space vehicles. The amount of fuel that must be carried by a satellite depends on the speed with which the thruster can eject it. Chemical rockets have very limited fuel exhaust speed. Plasmas can be ejected at much higher speeds; therefore less fuel need be carried on board. The Hall thruster was invented in the late 1950's. Until the mid 1990's, it has been developed primarily by the Russians. During the past 30 years, the Russian placed in orbit more than 100 Hall thrusters. However, the vast majority of satellites worldwide have relied on chemical thrusters and, to a lesser extent, arc jet thrusters and ion thrusters.
    A conventional electrostatic ion thruster consists of two grids, an anode and a cathode, between which a voltage drop occurs. Positively charged ions accelerate away from the anode toward the cathode grid and through it. After the ions get past the cathode, electrons are added to the flow, neutralizing the output to keep it moving. A thrust is exerted on the anode-cathode system, in a direction opposite to that of the flow. Unfortunately, a positive charge builds up in the space between the grids, limiting the ion flow and, therefore, the magnitude of the thrust that can be attained.  
    In a Hall thruster, electrons injected into a radial magnetic field neutralize the space charge. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field is approximately 100-200 gauss, strong enough to trap the electrons by causing them to spiral around the field lines in the coaxial channel. The magnetic field and a trapped electron cloud together serve as a virtual cathode. The ions, too heavy to be affected by the field, continue their journey through the virtual cathode. The movement of the positive and negative electrical charges through the system results",0

Three or four editors have censored the section in question; ten have maintained it. The three or four are very loud and aggressive, and claim to represent a consensus; that is just the  rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning (claiming that one's opinion represents the popular will, in order to con new people into adopting it, and thus bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy).

But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.

The Canadian BDS Airplay Chart is a very well-known chart because it's one of the only radio charts that does not use """"recurrent play"""" to remove songs, which means that """"Promiscuous"""" could re-enter in ten years' time. I'm surprised that Canadian charts are being treated exactly like Billboard charts, but they are very different; for example, the Canadian Dance Chart is not as well known as the airplay chart, but it's still in the article. This is likely because it's being used in the same way, but that's not right. Here it was claimed that non-Canadians should not include the airplay chart if their single did enter the Canadian Singles Chart. However, because it's clearly notable (and because Furtado is Canadian), it's use here is appropriate.  """,0

"""

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

 Clear View 
Hi, thanks for message. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. 
It was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. Examples of unsourced claims presented as fact include: local and architectural importance... successful and well regarded...  enjoyed a wonderful and unobstructed view... luscious... tremendously modern dream home
... a favourable spot — and so on... it reads like an estate agent's blurb

The gothic culture was a horror movement. The first goths look like corpses with white faces, occult symbols etc. There was no aesthetic or romantic thing. This romantic thing is a phenomenon of the 1990s or an influence of the new romantic movement and has nothing to do with the traditional gothic subculture. The same with Gothic architecture, Gothic novels etc. The name of the Gothic subculture came from the Gothic music, a dark, punky music genre, related to death rock and horrorpunk. There was no relation to the Gothic architecture, but a preference for dead and old buildings in ruins, cemetaries, symbols of decay, etc. It was a """"death romanticism"""". The term """"gothic"""" means """"dark, gloomy, spooky"""". I agree, that there are new developments. But now you have a culture without any relation to the roots.

Three Vulcans XM597, 598 and 607 are identified in the Operation Black Buck article as being involved in operational bombing missions. The article on the Handley Page Victor states that it was retired nine years after the last Vulcan. Unfortunately, the Vulcan article does not give a last operational use date, although note should be taken that, according to the article, the last production Vulcans were delivered to the RAF in January 1965. Can someone clarify the dates and modify the dates in the relevant articles please? Vulcans and Victors must have been operational in 1982. If the Vulcans were retired immediately after the Falklands War (1982), Victors must have been operational until 1991. It seems to me that there are so many inconsistencies that clarification is essential to meet the Military History project objectives.",0

""":::What we are creating with Wikipedia is not set in stone. It is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable, and personally I don't agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been around since 2007, Jeh has been around since 2005, and Dsimic has been editing a lot since 2013 (in other words, enough to get a very good idea of how Wikipedia's anarchist system works). I'm glad that Jeh prefaced his statement with """"in my opinion"""" because that's what Wikipedia is about, and no personal statement (or even an essay such as commonly-cited arguments to avoid essay) is law. We debate a lot. I know just how much sucks but it's the way it is. Now, whether or not product lists are not-so-good articles is (debatably, if you you're axiologically inclined) an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users, or our editors if they're not your priority. In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. Lists in general are not easy candidates for """"good articles""""; as I recall, back around 2008 or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories, but when I pointed to WP:CSL, the steam was taken out even though that didn't change the sensibility of the decisions.

The term is also found in Piers Anthony's Prosthy Plus, which may have been published as early as 1967 in Worlds of If, and as a novel in 1971 (but I only found the term in a 1986 reprint of the book copyrighted to 1973 so it's hard to say... However, it does seem that the term originated before Beter's mention of it in 1979 at least.

 Attempt at close of old RfC 

That is, the RfC listed on Archive 4 of this talk page, """"RfC: Does the article minimize the centrality of India to the notion of caste?"""" That the discussion wasn't closed earlier is of little surprise: it is long, it is technical, and the older it gets the less appetizing it gets: such discussions are very much not like Parmigiano-Reggiano. In fact, the discussion is so long that you'll have to accept the general conclusions I think I was able to draw without my being able to point at each and every individual comment supporting it. What I, as a non-Hundi-Indian currently middle-class college professor, conclude, are the following points:
Scholarly consensus appears to be that the caste system is still of the greatest importance to Hindu India; vice versa, discussions of the caste system in secondary and tertiary scholarly sources note the centrality of Hindu India to the very concept of """"caste"""".
Scholarly and especially less scholarly discussions on the concept of caste in other societies, esp. those outside SE Asia, mostly seem to use the term in the """"broader"""" sense signaled in various places in the RfCas a convenient shorthand for """"social stratification"""" and such. I note also that the application of the term """"caste"""" to some other cultures, popular until the 1970s and perhaps after, has now come under (academic) scrutiny and criticism.
Considering those two points, I conclude that it is 
The 1 September 2012 version of the article does suffer from OR and some coatracking; the current version is much better in that respect, though far from perfect. Note, for example, the very loose use of the word """"caste"""" in this newspaper article to warrant the inclusion of Cagot. As it turns out, there are sources """"comparing"""" their segregation to that of the Indian caste system: such a comparison is perhaps valid, but does not itself warrant calling them a caste.

Allow me a few observations and suggestions.
""""Caste"""" should (and this is supported in the RfC) include extensive discussion of the situation in India.
Examples from other cultures (some of which well established and verified in the current version of the article and associated main articles) must of course be thoroughly verified; an article from The Independent cannot suffice for what is, after all, an encyclopedic article.
I believe it is imperative (and comments in the RfC and elsewhere in the talk page archives support this) to come to a clarification of terms. The current lead does some of that already, but a separate section is warranted. Etymology should be the least important part of such a section; more important is a history of the usage of the termnot to be able to list every example of its usage, but rather to sketch the attractiveness of the paradigm to scholars of various periods, an attractiveness that has by now lost some of its currency. Parts of the lead of the 1 September 2012 version point to that as well; what's important is to delineate the term and its currency. Fowler&Fowler; cites Balkin in the RfC (""""social stratification in the United States does not really match the technical definition of caste ... caste is at best an effective hyperbole"""") and it's precisely that kind of research and criticism that need to be used here.
Sourcing should continue to be scrutinizedin Caste system in India, I read """"Caste is neither unique to Hindu religion nor to India; caste systems have been observed in other parts of the world, for example, in the Muslim community of Yemen, Christian colonies of Spain, and Japan"""", with one reference possibly very outdated (1972) and another a newspaper article from the New York Times. This is an article in which Wikipedia's crowdsourcing """"hey it's in the paper let's add it"""" needs to be held in check.

In all, I believe this was an interesting discussion in which the participants are perhaps closer to consensus than they thought. It is clear that there is no consensus that the article is redundant to Caste system in India etc.; it's clear also that there is consensus that the article should be much more focused than the 1 September 2012 version was, and that India must occupy a position of great(er) importance. In various places various quantified suggestions were made; I cannot comment on those numbers. I sensed some hesitance at perhaps """"borrowing"""" material from Caste system in Indiawell, if that's where good content on the concept of caste, its history, and its usage can be found, that's where you go.

While the """"circle notation"""" for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it. The """"Kekule notation"""" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and """"electron pushing"""" much more straightforward.

 Harrow 2013 
Doc James correctly reverted my removal of text cited to Harrow, noting that it is, in fact, a review although PubMed does not indicate so.  However, IMO the text in the article is too strong for what the source supports.  
conclusions from PMID 23512950, Harrow 2013 Overall, the longitudinal studies cited do not provide conclusive proof of a causal relationship between being off medications and being psychosis free. They do clearly indicate that not all schizophrenia patients need continuous antipsychotics for a prolonged period, providing extensive evidence of samples of medication-free schizophrenia patients with favorable outcomes.6,12,22 Is it at least a moderate-sized number of schizophrenia patients who do well, longitudinally, without medications? This important issue needs longitudinal research for more precise answers. The longitudinal studies indicate the importance of further research on how many schizophrenia patients profit from continuous administration of antipsychotics over a prolonged period, what factors identify and separate schizophrenia patients who do not need prolonged antipsychotic treatment, and whether or not prolonged use of antipsychotics is harmful for some or many patients.

The above-cited longitudinal results from many different countries and different types of schizophrenia patients provide data bearing on issues about long-term treatment. Discussions by Whitaker, Moncrieff, and others question long-term antipsychotic treatment.25–27 These disparate views, research by WHO and DOSMED in developing countries,12 and our own longitudinal studies5–7 should be considered as prompts for further long-term outcome research on this important issue.  This is not a strongly worded conclusion, where our article presents as fact what this article appears to be raising as an important question in need of further study.  I continue to believe this is not a strong enough source for the cited text.  Clearly, further research on this controversial matter is needed.  Can we either eliminate this source or reword the text to better match?  The strongest conclusion of this paper is that further study is needed.  Regards,  (Talk) """,0

I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there. I thought it was interesting.

I've never before seen someone else write about an """"American ethnicity"""" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a """"White ethnic group"""", not just racially, but ethnically as well.

The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. 

The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. 

I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. 

I've written all of this to demonstrate how the """"ethnic Americans"""" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as """"White"""" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an """"Ameican""""/""""US citizen"""" and an """"ethnic American"""" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.

I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. 

The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex-Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world.

Sorry for the lack of brevity. Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it. Also, I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole. Usually when I do",0

 Humor? Something needs to be done with this article... ;-) 

Hi, CSTAR! Of course, you are a great humorist, but something needs to be done in this situation. Those guys (Zarniwoot and FCZenz) are plain stupid. It seems, they still do not understand that this was only a demonstration of force. They do not understand, that, for example, we can spread the attack to much more articles. Fighting with us, Zarniwoot and FCZenz break WP policy all the time and, possibly, cause more damage here than we. Recently, SCZenz blocked an IP-address of an independent person. Crazy guy!

I left him a message about that and a notice that the article Introduction to quantum mechanics was already attacked two times without reversion and was already edited by three (!!!) people. That was the article that was defended already! Instead of recognition that he is unable to defend even several articles here, he just removed my post from the page, so that other people could not see, how stupid he is. (That happened already several times.) For what reason do we need such a crazy administrators here? They hurt WP more than help! How can be they so stupid?

Guerrero's reign """"With the victory, Cena earns a World Championship opportunity against the titleholder of his choice at WrestleMania XXIV on Sunday, March 30, in Orlando, Florida... but which champion will he choose to face? Will he go after the WWE Championship – currently held by Randy Orton – and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it? Or will Cena look to conquer a different mountain and challenge an old foe, World Heavyweight Champion Edge, or a new kingpin, ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero, for a title he has never worn?""""
Kane's reign """"Then there’s the state of the ECW Championship held by Kane, who was also drafted over to Raw on Monday. Although ECW gained the services of United States Champion Matt Hardy, the Land of the Extreme is now left with no World Champion of their own, and only a one-in-three chance to win it back at Night of Champions... On Sunday, the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry. While the World's Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown, the World's Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesday's Supplemental Draft, and is that brand's chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme. But, if Triple H, Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships, with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold.""""
Morrison's reign (Fast Forward to 3:30) """"These accolades are only fitting of a true champion, and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim. I am a World Champion. I am the new face of ECW. I am the ECW World Heavyweight Champion.""""

This is my first World Heavyweight Title and I'll tell you one thing, it's going take a more powerful man than I am to take this title out of my hands.""""Hardy's reign """"The greatest achievement, however, came in 2008 when Matt triumphed in a Championship Scramble Match to capture the ECW Title; his first taste of World Championship gold.""""Hardy's reign continued """"After the contest was unscrambled and the winner was clear, Matt Hardy stood victorious as the new ECW Champion in the opening Scramble Match at Unforgiven...

 Remedies 

These were removed from the article. While I agree that this had developed severe listcruft, surely some citations exist for some of these. Moved to talk page so people have an idea what to search for.
Potentially beneficial remedies
Aspirin: - acetylsalicylic acid, taken before turning in to bed (before, not after sleeping), might be effective.
 Consuming 3 grams of Butyl hydroxy toluen (BHT) prior to drinking is said to counter hangovers, by detoxifying acetaldehyde (presumably replacing gluthatione.)  BHT in this case is supposed to also block alcohol metabolism, so the person will stay drunk longer.
 Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.
Supposed remedies

Note: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles.
 Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly.
 Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy)
 Milk Thistle
 Angostura bitters and soda water
 Defecation
 Vomiting
 Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices.
 A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body.
 Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover.
 Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.)
 Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms.
 Cabbage leaves or tomato juice
 Bloody Mary
 Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce)
 Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a """"Prairie Oyster"""".
 Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover 
 Eating seafood is a popular """"remedy"""" in Chile.
 Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as """"Black Aspirin"""" (popular in Australia), also """"The Red Ambulance"""" (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis. 
 Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride.
 Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem.
 Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.  If useful, it may be for its antioxidant and-or vasodilatation / microcirculation properties.
 Drinking a couple of table spoons of olive oil is said to be of great help

Common folk medicine has a wide variety of supposed hangover cures. A good hangover cure should replace essential nutrients lost by the body while counteracting the influence of residual poisons; very few cures do both at once. Among the more common proposed cures are:

 Wigwag 

I posted on the second FARC nom for Wigwag (that you removed today) that just two days ago you'd asked for references on the page. I realized in looking at it again that you'd actually  asked for references one year and two days ago, without response.

You asked rather brusquely """"seriously?"""" of the nominator. Well ya, seriously, this seems as obvious a candidate as any and as dead a talk page as an FA can be.

Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.
Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.
The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said """"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,"""" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.
All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) 
Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase """"Legend in his own mind"""". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.77.220.178 (talk)

Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited.

I'll clear this up about my intentions:  I have been told, or glanced over (in passing) several materials purporting the Caribbean slave contribution to the population of Charleston and Savannah (among New Orleans and other multiracially populated areas).  It is also rather obvious about the romantic Pocahontas connection to ideas of Roanoke survivors, in discussions of Virginia.  These things are dismissed as fancy, but they are distinct beliefs of those who attempt to put a face on what the Melungeon community has had as an inception.  So you see, I am an extreme skeptic to the fantasies described by ignorant rednecks...but I do in fact think they are relevant to the beliefs of those promoting the Melungeon identity.  One need not endorse a belief of association, but merely allow others to see what sort of identities Melungeon life has acquired.  I am confident to declare that there is so much myth obfuscating the reality of what life is like in Appalachia.  Appalachian culture is from the Deep South to Maritime Canada.  Melungeon culture is centred on the Gulf coast and south of Bermuda on the Eastern seaboardoriginally Spanish areas.  People think that just because impoverished Scotch-Irish on the frontier dressed in buckskin and furs, that they were some """"noble savages"""" (though they were not Cherokee, but in fact Andrew Jackson's henchmen).  So many ideas here wreak of Crank (person) nonsense.  Are you the spin doctors making apologetics for the Antebellum South, by having it seem like the perpertrators are actually descended from the victims?  Are you sitting in a trailor right now, trying to deny your Jerry Springer lifestyle?  Civil War's Reconstruction is a real bitch?!

That white Spanish territory is the Melungeon core, in true history.

See here:
Hispanics contributed Melungeon heritage, via Louisiana and Florida colonies.  This was much different from slave owners who raped slaves to make more slaves.  Melungeons were basically the first Hispanics in the United States, whom often lived in secret or adapted to Anglo ways.  Please, do not spread fantasies as facts in this article!

 ==Tbma own original research 

First Tbma only a few days after calling this whole article a hoax has fund a new sources to breakdown this article to crap.

First he claims the Soviet had preplanned its withdraw from the front, but Finnish sources who is supported by POW interview, intellegnce data and Otho Manninen extended archives research in SOviet/Russian archives have pinpointed exactlly witch Soviet units where pressent in the battle and when they left.

What we now for certaint is: The composistion of the Soviet major combat formations where pressent, they Soviet was reinforced by 100 tanks and SPG before the battle, and during the battle 21 Soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle. 

This contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only 60000 Soviet red army men.

What about Tbma sources?

The Sources of 60000 men from """"Punaiset panssarit - Puna-armeijan panssarijoukot 1918-1945"""" is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank, and just uses a few phrases on the Tali-Ihantala battle.

 Dispute 

I noticed there's an edit war going on with regard to the debunkingprimaltherapy link, and the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section.

My opinion is as follows. I think the link at the end of the """"Primal Therapy"""" section should lead to the """"Primal Therapy"""" article, not to the criticism section specifically. I feel that way because the section in the page entitled """"Primal Therapy"""" is relevant to the entire primal therapy article (including the criticisms) and not to the criticisms alone.

It would be quite possible to have both links at the bottom of the paragraph (""""see Primal Therapy, including the criticism section...""""). I wouldn't be opposed to that. 

Personally I don't believe that the section """"Primal Therapy"""" should be on the biography page at all; we should have a link only: """"Arthur Janov is the creator of (linked) Primal Therapy, and author of many books on that subject"""". IMO there is no need to discuss primal therapy (or its criticisms) in any detail on a biography page, because those things are not biographical details. They are not relevant here. They belong in the Primal Therapy article, and there is no need to repeat that article here.

With regard to the DBT.com link. I don't believe this page is an appropriate place for any kind of dispute about Primal Therapy, one way or the other, since this article is not about Primal Therapy. I don't believe that we should include here links to any sites unless they are specifically relevant to the biography of Arthur Janov. If we do have any such links  (like the DBT.com link) then we must revisit the whole debate here, and we must include other links, otherwise we violate NPOV by representing only one side. It would be better just not to have such links.

Bear in mind that Art Janov is an exceedingly minor historical figure. His biography should be only a few paragraphs. It's not really the best place for an extensive argument.

I realize you guys are concerned about people being led astray by reading the wiki, but I really don't think that's a major concern. Anyone who follows a """"Primal Therapy"""" link and reads the article will realize that Primal Therapy has been criticized. The readers aren't dense and don't need things repeated. In other words, I don't think anyone could be misled or led astray by a simple link (and nothing more) on the biography page.

We should achieve some kind of consensus before editing the article. If we can't achieve consensus then we should solicit outside opinion.

This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

 Unblock 

Hello, Mike. After thinking very long and carefully, I have taken the (for me) unusual step of unblocking a user you blocked without consulting you first. You blocked Helvitica Bold indefinitely, giving the reason as """"Vandalism-only account"""". I have looked at a sample of 20 of the user's 153 edits excluding their user page, and did not find a single one that I could conceive of anyone calling """"vandalism"""". Even if there were vandalism edits somewhere among them that I missed, this cannot possibly be described as a """"vandalism-only account"""". The user page contained some silly editing, and it might be debatable whether to call it """"use of Wikipedia for inappropriate humour"""" or """"vandalism"""", but at the most it might have justified a warning. An indefinite block on a user with a significant history of positive contributions because of a silly user page seems dubious, and for such a block to be imposed without any warnings is surely unacceptable. If I have missed something which puts the block in a different light than that in which I have seen it then please let me know.   """,0

First you make it up re the old page, then want me to apologise over something you just made up.  I think it might be good if you stop making these fanciful stories up and stop trying to stir.  You cannot see my computer settings or know that even with them set to empty, I also manually empty the cache and everything else each time I close explorer which is very very often, so that little fairy story you just spun, goes nowhere.

If you are an admin, then time to retire perhaps, or to go be retrained.  How about you take your block tools, go find a quite contemplative spot, lock yourself into it and spare contributers here the nonsense as its banal, boring and totally and utterly immature.

I do not need you handing out this wrong advice you seem duty bound to hand out spinning totally incorrect possibles (to an olde rperson - is that ageism?) and then threatning punishment if I dont bend to your """"possible"""" delusions.  Your behaviour here isnt helping a thing, and here is about  putting information on this article not how great you or any other tool holder is, believe it or not.

Go learn some manners instead of trying to spin me ridiculous porkies about cache etc when you have no idea what my cache does or doesnt.  

If you use your stupid tools hope u get yr jollies off them.  All you will get this end is total disdain for trying that cache story on.  Go be a pest elsewhere instead of trying to stir here up again when its now not too disruptive.

"up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. Through those progresses, he performed robbery on a bank, produced porn films,",0

Notability of Arte Calle
A tag has been placed on Arte Calle requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0

In some parts of Canada the situation is legislatively divided into warring U.S. and British camps . For instance, in British Columbia and Alberta, Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M.) still exist. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Yukon,and N.W.T standards are slightly higher and are based on quackery-based charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves """"Podiatrists"""". In Manitoba, for example, about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves """"Dr."""" despite having bogus (3-4 year) qualifications. This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPM's. In the province of Ontario, MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist. Consequently, there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists ( ie. American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine). Unfortunately, both share a governing body, the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. To accelerate Ontarians into confusing U.S. trained podiatrists with bogus UK """"podiatrists"""", the British Chiropodists who are in greater number, heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating & maintaining the banned prefix """"Dr."""" and the associated title """"podiatrist"""". Unbelievably, and quite maliciously, British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPM's who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist. This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications.

Speedy deletion of The Wrong Trousers (Band)
 A tag has been placed on The Wrong Trousers (Band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

 [In my future writings on the Lamé equation and uniformization, I hope that I might become the sock puppet of Felix Klein.] My personal connection with the Evans affair is the same as yours, but perhaps less so -)

 There is nothing underhanded in adding references to mathscinet and UNCC documents that Evans himself made publicly available. Both these references speak volumes.

 I am very glad that Evans' wikipedia page has been reduced to a stub. In its present form, however, the statements presented there cannot be verified by a wikipedia reader. Some link to the historical notes on the aias website seems necessary to make these statements verifiable. 

 I cannot understand why there are wikipedia pages on scientific cranks. However if these pages exist, the crankery should be made immediately apparent. I think my additions to this page have been: the mathscinet references which exposed the crankery; pointing out that the University of Glamorgan is a former polytechnic with no prowess in pure science; that Evans got himself fired from UNCC; and his invention of the idiotic term """"Cartan geometry"""".

Have it as another tab on the tabs already on GA pages
Specifically go out to recruit people, either dropping personal notes at talk pages, wikiprojects and the signpost (maybe even a watchlist header if you can swing it)
Advertise it as purely to get inexperienced editors reviewing. Make it clear that there will be help right the way through the process and they can't really make too much of a mess.
See if you can get some regulars who are willing to have their articles reviewed by these new reviewers. That should help alleviate any biting issues. The bonus for the regulars is that they will get there articles reviewed faster.
I would not treat this as a way to clear the backlog, but to get those reviewers who have considered reviewing, but were a little unsure whether they could.

Merged with Pentateuch
I merged this article with Pentateuch; there was nothing in the Pentateuch article that was not already in the Torah article, so there wasn't much point in making the distinction. If the article were to be recreated, I would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the Torah. podous 

 Dates and Wellhausen 

I think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:

It must be noted that Wellhausen's knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]

These dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).

So people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  

Adding that shift to Kantor's dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen's dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.

Furthermore, what is important for Wellhausen's history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.

I don't think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    

I'm not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.
You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.
What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be """"adjusted"""" to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. 
I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for """"the modern secular dating"""". In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.
Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. 
This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I'd like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai 

The dates need not be """"scholarly"""". They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I'd say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. Lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required, however, deletion of what constitutes cultural me",0

 Hello and Sorry 
Hello Alison I was unblocked for good behavior and wanted to tell you I am sorry for what happened in the past.

Quoting Benjamin Franklin """"Insanity is doing the same thing, and expecting different results"""".

For the reader unfamiliar with the situation, the block was set in response to my repeated use of the phrase """"deletionist vandals"""" on several AfD entries; according to karmafist, I was being an asshole to deletionists (who do indeed disagree with me) by calling them """"vandals"""".

Now, karmafist, you and I both know that there are people who think it is acceptable to replace the contents of Snoopy with, say, """"Snoopy is a shitfaced cockmaster.""""  I disagree with those people, and I'm sure you do, too.  In fact, there are lots of people who doand they refer to the aforementioned individuals as """"vandals"""".  However, they are never blocked for this.  Since, according to you, """"being an asshole to people who disagree with you"""" is a blockable offense, it follows that one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does not constitute being an asshole, in which case I should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists (who disagree with me) """"vandals"""", I was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me.
Your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false, in which case I should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.

Or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him.  Again, one of the following must be true:
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does constitute assholery, in which case one can infer (from the fact that those who refer to the Snoopy types as """"vandals"""" have never been blocked for that) that it is acceptable to engage in this specific type of assholery towards those who are indeed vandalsand, as I proved on User talk:Aaron Brenneman, deletionists are indeed vandals (you claimed that my proof was """"bullshit"""" and that it did not need refutation, but your assertion does not make it so)
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" does NOT constitute assholery, in which case it's all irrelevant since, as I was not being an asshole, the conditions under which being an asshole is acceptable are not an issue.
Calling someone a """"vandal"""" only constitutes assholery if it is false, in which case see the above-mentioned proof as to why that is not the case here.

Now, which of these alternatives is it?  Alternately, you can show me a fallacy (if I were you, I would try and find a false dichotomyor trichotomy, for that matteras my argument rests on showing you how none of the possible conclusions of your argument justify a block on me; perhaps you will be able to find an alternative I have missed that does indeed justify blocking me) or a mistaken premise and I will gladly concede that my behavior was wrong and was deserving of a block, and will change in the future.

Well, one issue at a time:
The last sentence of the 1st paragraph truncates the narrative by jumps from one subject (internal policy) to another (foreign policy), before falling from the sky after decades to following paragraph without even suggest the reason of 1920s military revolts (not to mention that even remotely touches the civilian ones).
To remedy the last flaw of this paragraph, and with citations (easy to check) in English (other section's defect: too many sources in Portuguese, one of them is not even specific to Brazilian history) and
before to deal with the 2nd paragraph [ one issue at a time ) ], I suggest to let the 1st paragraph fine and end the discussion about this paragraph, 
I propose that the mention concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries  in the early 20th century (even because, the border issue of Acre, in addition to not being the only one of that era, contained in itself a military phase, among others, having not been characterized or reduced to a mere purchase...), be placed at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph in the foreign affairs: 
 """"In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period,* was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations,* after its involvement in World War I.***"""" ; 
more or less eg as I had proposed, both with a neutral point of view and specific easily checking citations in english...

67.121.104.204  

I think you're confused in regards to the definition of state. I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word """"state"""" than the """"US state"""" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" are all translated as """"國"""" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction. The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called """"中華民國國防部"""" (國 = nation), the United Nations is called """"聯合國"""" (國 = nation), the United States Department of State is called """"美國國務院"""" (國 = state), the Commonwealth of Independent States is called """"獨立國家聯合體"""" (國 = state),  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called """"石油輸出國組織"""" (國 = country).

But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.

With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?

The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?

Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.

I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.

I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.

The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).

All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —  (talk · contribs) """,0

There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS.

The place to talk about this is on the massacre talk page but I think you should read the archives to this page very carefully because the problem with the word massacre is exactly the same as with the word WP:TERRORIST a word with intrinsically negative connotations that are generally applied to the actions one's enemies and opponents.

Do you think we should have a page on """"Carnage"""" and """"Bloody slaughter"""" as well as massacre? If not why not?
 
Also I would question much of what you have listed above for example the """"Earliest source"""" which is the area of the OED specalises in is 1578 R. LINDSAY Hist. & Cron. Scotl. (1899) II. 291 The xxiiij day of August..the grytt..murther and messecar of Paris wes committit. for the noun and 1588 J. PENRY Viewe Publ. Wants Wales 65 Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules..are dangerous subjects. for the verb and this is a dictionary issue not an encyclopaedia issue. I would go through others but lets skip strait to the categories you have suggested. For example there is a strong case for saying that many massacres are not """"Human rights abuses"""" because the term is attached to many events that are not, or were not human rights abuses. For example there is nothing in the dictionary definition that stops any mass killing within the laws of war being described as a massacre but that is not a human rights abuse, or are you going to make up a roll you own definition?

"""
 logic, please: the primary reason to date for retaining this picture is NOTCENSORED; that is a misapplication of policy if the image has no encyclopedic value, therefore IAR is applied to remove that reason, which allows for removing the image as unencyclopedic.  Editing policy only applies if (again) the content has encyclopedic value, which is exactly the point I'm disputing.  and last I checked (if this were a vote, which it isn't) the RfC was 9 to 6 in favor of removing, though some of the 6 in favor of keeping put a lot of effort into rationalizing that result away.
 Repeating myself yet again: you are not going to win this debate by quoting policy at me, because I can quote policy just as well as you can (possibly better).  you are not going to win this debate by using insulting terminology like 'scraping the bottom of the barrel'.  I know how to deal with pointless rhetorical snark, and it doesn't phase me in the least.  you are either going to have to give a reason explaining why this content is valuable - which would be the decent thing to do - or else you're all going to have to stick to the current practice of bullying and edit warring to keep the content in.  I'm happy to discuss the matter if you choose that route, I'm sanguine with (and capable of) refuting all of your policy misconstruals, and if you want to go the other path I'll see if I can get some other reasonable editors to come and help me remove it unreasonably.  I don't really care which way it goes; you should choose whichever makes you most comfortable.  Ludwigs2 """,0

"Welcome!

Hello, Director.sara, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

No one responded to my opposing Taxman but you and Kylu started to comment on my oppose vote against you insisting that I explain myself. If that discussion affected others, it is not my fault. I was asked for the explanation and I provided it upon request.

Fair use rationale for Image:VWK70.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:VWK70.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced. By the way, the version where you described your addition as """"your research"""" shows another problem: Even if it is true, original research is in principle unsuited for Wikipedia.

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

"Tidying
I did a fair bit of tidying on this article. I think my edit summaries are pretty self-explanatory, except that I wanted to elaborate slightly on the bits that I simply removed. 

I deleted additional details about Joe Gold except for the facts directly related to Gold's Gym. The deleted info is already included in the article about Joe Gold.

 I'm short of time at the moment, and a lot of the policy and guideline pages have had their content shuffled around, but here is a recent template deletion discussion that illustrates some of the problems with SourceWatch as a reliable source. Beyond issues of bias, the main reason that open wikis are not allowed as reliable sources is that one can never guarantee what is going to appear on the screen at any given random time, when the source page is loaded. It could be good info, or it could be """"POOP"""". That is the main reason that Wikipedia is not allowed to source itself, and the principle holds for all wikis. As to the Drudge issue, I think that the arguments presented on Talk:George Soros in opposition to including well-sourced criticism from Bill O'Reilly apply here, and Eleemosynary was a strong opponent of including that information in the Soros article. The O'Reilly criticism is nowhere near as harsh and derogatory as the piece I removed from Drudge. O'Reilly is certainly more notable (as is his opinion) than the NYPress author. I really would like to see a consistent treatment of sources in all articles, and I try to apply that wherever I edit, but I already have about a thousand articles on my watchlist, so I can't fix everything. -  """,0

"Smalley's postion on these matters is essentially the same in his most recent work - he is still writing on the subject.  Moreover, Smalley's perception is also that of many other leading authorities on the Gospels in the early church; such as [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland), who may not (unlike Smalley), be specialists in the Johannine literature.  The pespectives reperesented in the article as it is currently, represent (to my reading) one particular strand of the 'redaction critical' approach.  Broadly, this approach shares with Smalley/Rowland, a decreased tendency to regard the Synoptic Gospels as transmitting a 'historical' source.  But the corollary is to treat both the gospel genre; and much of the charactersistic gospel content; as a theological construct - specifically due to the author of Mark.  But if Mark 'invented' the feeding in the wilderness as a theological construct, then the presence of the same story in John shows dependence.  But this view of Mark is not by any means a consensus; many scholars (like Smalley and Rowland) would maintain that there were indeed independent 'historical' accounts of Jesus's ministry and gospel message that preceded both the Synpoptics and John, and provided the basis for their common narrative material.

I observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals.

Information needing to be inserted into the article
The translation needs to be continued, and the result wikified and styled. Taken from here. Moved here because Markstreet reverted the article for the 15th time, and I already reverted two times. 

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

 Metacompiler 

Hay I see you contributed to compiler-compiler and to the metacompiler page adding a CWIC topic

It seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles it's self I.E.

Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

A common saying on FORTH sites. Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as Forth does.

Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of the Language Development Group at Kontron electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended PASCAL. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In Circuit Emulators supported. Actually I started with FutureData that was bought be GenRad and then sold to Kontron.

A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language.
 
Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [Sci-Tech Dictionary McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.""""

We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature:

""""The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" 
Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what.

The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.

There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like BOOK1, BOOK2, and CWIC are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was:

""""A compiler-building system developed by Brooker and Morris"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"BNF"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage.

CWIC was based partly on Schorre's META compilers and partly on LISP2 developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from TREE META. Is unclear of Schorre worked on TREE META. Thhe Stanford Research paper does not list Schorre. 

I implemented an extended CWIC compiler compiler on a DEC-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the CWIC generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in CWIC documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has EVAL calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables.

I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.

Val Schorre submitted papers in the SegForth ACM group in the 80s. Val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced).

That is 7,000 articles we as a community have referenced in 17 days, and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:
User_talk:The-Pope#Your_idea_at_Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment.2FBiographies_of_living_people 
As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible. As an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past 4 years, and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles, this is a wonderful comprimise, with so much potential, I would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal.

Distortion of sources by by lowering the number of casualties from 6,000 to 35 in the Gemlik Yalova massacres

 questions all sources which he doesn't like on the other hand he adds (""""retaliates"""") without hesitation weak sourced massacres (with large numbers)committed by Turks against Greeks in the List of massacres in Turkey.( See, See) This already proves his unreliable POV behaviour, eagerly adding, without questioning the source, info that Turks massacred Greeks but insisting and denying that Turks were massacred by Greeks. (Btw, I don't deny any sourced massacre regardless of the perpetrators and victims)

From the moment I made this article, Alexikoua started to disrupt the article, he is WP:IDLI from the beginning, very biased he tried to deny it, than shift the blame to others, and finally lowering the death toll from 6,000 to 35 by distorting this source page which does not state that the total killed were 35, it states
""""Of the total 177 people (in a refugee camp in Istanbul) responding to a (Ottoman) questionnaire 28 individuals responded that they had family members harmed during the Greek occupation. In total only 35 were reported to be killed, wounded beaten or missing. This is in line with the observations of Toynbee declared that one to two murders were sufficient in driving away the population of a given village""""

He misuses this source and claims the total number killed during the events was 35(!). I explained to him,again that in individual cases the number already exceeds 35.
Furthermore Toynbee states that in one single  village called Hayriye (Khairie) half of the population was killed, according to a Ottoman document it had 250 inhabitants, at another village called Akköy (Akkeu) 60 people were killed, so the death toll of two villages has already exceeded 100. Furthermore the source never states that 35 is the total number of people killed in the peninsula. It is only the result of a questionnaire to 177 people. Furthermore Toynbee states that there were no large scale massacres in one specific region, not in other areas, his words are again distorted.

But Alexikoua still insists on distorting the source, I explained it countless times, he still insists, here here here, ], here, here and here.

He also amateurishly did original research to deny sourced content. See here, he ignores all other sources and insists on saying """"Toynbee's account about 35 as a total number of reported casualties is the only we have so far""""( Which in fact is a lie because it is not Toynbee's account but from the Ottoman questionnaire of 177 people)

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car. If he ends Taker's streak I will come and burn down WWE head quarters while leaving a message that say another building burns unless Triple H is fired.C """,1

Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on July 13, 2001, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by an absolute majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.

"New Criticism Redux 

Dear Moni3 – 
I think you’re on to something when you wrote, “…New Criticism should be represented with emphasis appropriate to how much information exists.”
The impact of the New Critics is still felt today; even Wolff’s analysis is influenced by it. H. Bruce Franklin wrote:

“The hallmark of New Critical methodologyintricately detailed and nuanced readings of textswas actually a corollary of these texts deemed worthy of study, texts filled with elaborate ambiguities and ironies, texts therefore not easily accessible to common readers.” Go read Wolff; you’ll see.

Providing a section on Second Wave feminist “critique” and the New Critics is a balanced - and informative – approach. Both should be expanded prudently; I’ve initiated that project. 

Undue Weight (WP:UNDUE )?  If you take the trouble to read the section, you’ll see it’s related to arguments about, say, “global warming”, where 99.9% of scientists recognize the human causes, and 0.1% do not. Providing equal space for the latter is an example of “undue weight.”  Applying it to a section on the New Criticism is a red herring.

As the Untruthkeeper/Maria opined, “everything in moderation”; except a proprietary approach to editing and a “Dog in the Manger” attitude towards new contributors. 

Oh, by the way, the material that was dumped in the New Criticism was done so without including the reference; rather slipshod, I’d say. Scamper over there and take care of that “edit”, won’t you, Maria? Mysweetoldetc.",0

"""Haplogroup L lineages are relatively infrequent(less than 1%) throughout Europe with the exception of Iberia, where frequencies as high as 11.7% percent have been reported. These lineages had previously been associated with the African slave trade. However an analysis by Gonzalez et al revealed that most of the L lineages matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods. 

Haplogroup L lineages are present at low frequencies in Eastern Europe. Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain.

 Collegiality 

I defy anyone to find so much as an ounce of collegiality in yesterday's sham (and atrociously scripted) Bill of Attainder.

Thomas Jefferson was demonstrating collegial insight when he led the civilized world in abandoning Bill of Attainder, having recognized that it's a corrosive and corrupt tool of government that inevitably sinks any regime that comes to rely on it.  Shortly after the Founders outlawed Bill of Attainder in Article I of the US Constitution, the British followed suit, abandoning both Parliamentary Bill of Attainder and Monarchial Bill of Attainder.

It's disturbing to witness you and other misguided officials reintroducing this antiquated relic from the rubbish heap of political history into the current practices of Wikiversity.  Is this the kind of unwise practice you wish to teach to impressionable youth of the 21st Century?  Can you imagine what would happen to anyone who tried to adopt and employ that hoary and unsustainable practice in the real world of an authentic 21st Century learning organization?

I strongly suggest the title of the article, and all further references to the disease within the article, be changed from Crohn's disease to Crohn disease. The disease was named after one of the pathologists who first described the condition, he did not have the disease himself, which is what having the """"'s"""" added to the end of the last name implies. E.g. Down did not have Down syndrome, so it should not be called Down's syndrome, whereas those who refer to ALS as Lou Gehrig's Disease are correct in the term because he had this disease.

 It is all just terminology 

Perhaps all this argument is about nothing but terminology.  Does anyone disagree with any of the following statements?  It is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly, the players initial pick is random, and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat.

1) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 3, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

2) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 2, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability)

3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors, is 2/3 for all host preferences. (Morgan call this the unconditional case, maybe this is where the confusion arises).

4) The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 2/3 for all host preferences.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is 2/3 for all host preferences.

  
You're right. And notice that in case 3, opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition, because it is part of the rules of the game. The only condition, if you would consider the full model, there is the initial picking of door 1. In case 4 there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case 5. But ... notice that in the MHP a specific door has been chosen and a door opened.  

I continue here. The difficulty is what we do mean by probability. If you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened, there is, as I mentioned, no condition. If you mean: a door has been opened, but I do not know which one, and I want to average over all cases concerning the same door, the answer depends on the door and is a number between 1/2 and 1.   

I do not quite agree with you.  If we average over all cases where a door has been opened, but you do not know which one, the answer is 2/3 if we include all possible host strategies in our average.  The only way to get an answer other than 2/3 is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time.   

Nijdam, do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door?  If the player picks randomly the probability of winning is 1/2.  If the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement.   
  
Who else agrees?   

I agree with #1 and #2.  I find #3, #4 and #5 somewhat ambiguous without further clarification, for example I don't know precisely what you mean by """"for all host preferences"""".  I would agree with the following revised versions:

By 'for all host preferences' I mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to: always open door 2 where possible, always open door 3 where possible, choose randomly where there is a choice, or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules.   
  
3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1, is 2/3.

4) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked a door, is 2/3.

5) The probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is 2/3.

These are clearly """"unconditional"""" statements that say nothing about the player deciding after the",0

Hello,

I do understand that Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia - but still some kind of very basic ethicalrules shall be applicable and obliging to all editors.I noticed that you have a person whose nick name is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab and whose number of edits goes over 60 per day very often spanning 5-11 hours dayly. This person is extremely agressive and intolerant and his/her edits are causing a lot of damage and irritated many people.

The best way to describe his/her behaviour and 'contributions' are given by a few people which can be summarised/quoted this way:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Spylab&oldid;=65026476

'I am probably from the USA and like to scrap others' contributions due to what I call """"factual correctness"""" - instead of knowing the facts and reporting them!'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Spylab/User_talk:Spylab/archive3#What.27s_is_the_problem.3F.3F.3F

'I've noticed that you are editing someone's contribution by altering the text under pretext of grammar corrections - not reading references at all. Moreover, not reading the references nor providing your own - you are demanding new references.

Also, on January 12th you've made 65 edits on various articles in the span of more than 11 hours(merge, clean, copy, revert, etc). Don't you think that it might be seen as something wrong with you if you are spending day after day, hours and hours - practically not contributing anything serious to Wikipedia, only irritating many people this way???'

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#About_Basic_Editorial_Ethics_Here

'When seeing that the existing edition of the Croatia section here, was reduced by User:Spylab to just 6 sentences out of which four were marked by the [citation needed] tag . Moreover, User:Spylab 'completed' his own 'editorial' work by adding {unreferenced|date=November 2006} and {weasel} tags on the top of this page!!! How a serious editor could tag/mark his own edits this way??? I reverted the section demanding explanation for this almost complete section destruction. Ultimately, the existing edits cannot be re-written or destroyed by just throwing claim 'replaced content with info from Neo-Nazism in Croatia because old version didn't focus on neo-Nazism' as he did.

All my attempts to bring the editorial work on the same start and support any further editorial work with facts and serious observations - failed. Instead even willing to discuss the issue seriously, User:Spylab started throwing accusations 'last edit brok 3RR rule', 'you may be blocked' , 'sock-puppetry' etc. and selfpraising (User:Spylab) work as superior and claiming that I do not know what Neo-Nazism is. My attempt (questions) to ask him why he deleted what he deleted already - are removed from the talk page and when I've put back the deleted questions - User:Spylab ignored them completely.

I had impression that I have to deal with an extremely cheeky and primitive personality and wondered how this person could have any access to the editirial work here. Then, I went further and examined the whole User:Spylab editorial work and noticed that User:Spylab commited more than 500 changes within 10 days i.e. more than fifty edits per day - (November 28 - December 7 2006). In that period of time [User:Spylab] was busy by the Wikipedia editing on: November 29 - 9 hours, November 30 - 16 hours (63 edits!!!) , December 1 - 18 hours, December 2 - 7 hours, December 3 - 8 hours, December 4 - 21 hours, December 5 - 12 hours, December 6 - 17 hours, and December 7 - 8 hours.

The content of User:Spylab edits were - spelling check, version reverts, removal of links, copy-paste etc. So it is quite clearly that I had to deal with a mentally challenged person!!!

I just wonder how it is possible that a serious publisher could allow such access to the articles to a person like User:Spylab.' As per his/her own words, as an Neo-Nazism in Croatia section editor, Spylab publicly claims

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neo-Nazism#Page_protection_sought

'Actually, it's not complicated at all. The revert war has nothing to do with point of view, and I am not an expert on Croatia at all.'

My note - how then this person should edit some subject (s)he is not familirar with? Also, all references written in Croatian and given here in the Neo-Nazism in Croatia were removed. As per Spylab question here

Dana, I see you keep posting about the studies at Homeopathy. You were adviced by Jehochman to take a holiday on the homeopathy article and I also did advice you to do that. You should trust more the other editors there to decide what studies are RS for the article:
this is picking on one of the sources provided by Scientizzle and dismissing the rest as not valid. This sort of behaviour is starting to piss other editors off and is starting to show on their comments. Please just accept that Scientizzle provided sources to back his statement.
this one? wtf? how many times has WP:UNDUE been discussed on those talk pages?

Please start accepting that you might be wrong about the studies you bring for addition to the articles.

"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

Forgive me if I try to be brief. It's very early in the morning here, and I haven't slept yet. It's understandable that you didn't know of any active projects connected to WP:CVG when you made your proposal - It's not as if any of us are being paid to be here, are we? Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.

I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told). I believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation, so the changes were reverted. I still have the same concerns about your proposal. Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.

Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. The characters article you linked to was a good start, but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series, if only to make navigation more convenient. That's all that I'm prepared to say while I'm half-asleep, but if you have any more questions for me personally, I'll respond when I'm able to.  07:16",0

 Demand for too many sources 

Some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. For example, the request for a secondary source for the fact that The Inquirer has criticized the publication of EG's real name. This is utter rubbish. From WP:NOR:

An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.

The section in question states: """"The Inquirer has criticized this deletion[8] as well as the revelation of the model's real name during the deletion discussions by Wikipedia users (the model's name and identity had been kept confidential by The Inquirer).[9]""""

We comply with (1): the claim is only descriptive (it reproduces what the Inq stated in their article) and is EASILY verifiable. The information is also not interpreted, thus we also comply with (2). As such, I'm removing the redundant second source.

Further, I recently added a citation for Mike Magee's quote from BusinessWeek. Again, I am removing this. The quote appears in the earlier reference to the same BusinessWeek article, and citations are allowed to span multiple sentences. """,0

 Removed text from article 
You're right the history section needs serious work.  I have removed it from the article because, I believe, it is a lot of conjecture.  It certainly doesn't jive with what I've read on the subject, and goes contrary to information found in referenced articles, for example country dance originating in frontier towns.  I would suggest that the country dance section of the folk dance article is read carefully.  

I would also suggest that careful citing of references in this history section will make it a lot better.  What happened to the role of the """"dance master"""", and of """"recorded music""""?  These are both important aspects of the caller's history.

It's a little too hit-and-miss for my taste.   

History
The role of the dance caller or cuer came out of necessity, given the origins of folk dance in America, but also in various cultures throughout the world.

In America, you can find many examples throughout history of frontier towns (where country dance originated) having people with traditions and dance styles from all over the world.  It was customary for people, when they finished work for the day, or when the week was over, to relax and go to a community dance event.  Everyone from town came.

Having people, however, from all sorts of different cultures caused problems.  People from one culture would know a certain type of music, or certain steps; and while there was some overlap in a few cases, the different steps were very confusing to those who didn't know the dances.  Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.

Thus, the country dance caller was created out of necessity.  Rather than only the dances they knew from each caller, someone was called upon (or more often just came about in an effort to help everyone have a good time) who learned the dances and steps of everyone, and each town created their own list of dance steps.

As towns expanded, and people travelled, these new callers (named such because they called out what you were to do next in each dance) were able to learn from each other and each other's styles to the point where, modernly, there is a full Callerlab devoted to maintaining a list of proper square dance calls, integrating new calls and styles of dance, and generally supporting and promoting new ideas in square dance calling, as well as up-and-coming callers.""",0

"Some Small Fixes
I have tried to give the article some balance. Bacque was actually an accomplished writer in Canada before Other Losses, but it is important to point out Other Losses was his first foray into history.
I think it's important to point out Bacque is talking about losses among German POWs held by the Western Allies. Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.

"“Mark the cousin [a·ne·psi·os′] of Barnabas.” (Ac 23:16; Col 4:10) In Luke 21:16, the Greek words syg·ge·non′ (relatives, such as cousins) and a·del·phon′ (brothers) both occur, showing that the terms are not used loosely or indiscriminately in the Greek Scriptures.  

Matthew 1:25; notice the word until, indicates Mary did not remain a virgin her whole life. 

Some haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth. Thought the gospels several times point fact. However scholars have noted two things about the theories, that Mary borne no other children: One there is a motivate behind such theories, to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later; the church teaching that Mary remained a virigin throught her life. Two, the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example, one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers, sons of Joseph by a earlier marriage. This notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny Jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of David, another theory is, that were actually cousins of Jesus although the Greek scriptures use distinct words for brother, cousin, and relative. Thus scholar Frank E. Gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of Mary and Joseph they were brothers of Jesus on his mother’s side.

Matt. 13:53-56, Jerusalem Bible: “When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district; and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, ‘Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? This is the carpenter’s son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers [Greek, a•del•phoi´] James and Joseph and Simon and Jude? His sisters [Greek, a•del•phai´], too, are they not all here with us?’” (On the basis of this text, would you conclude that Jesus was Mary’s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters?)

The New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967, Vol. IX, p. 337) admits regarding the Greek words a•del•phoi´ and a•del•phai´, used at Matthew 13:55, 56, that these “have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the Greek-speaking world of the Evangelist’s time and would naturally be taken by his Greek reader in this sense. Toward the end of the 4th century (c. 380) Helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to Mary other children besides Jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families. St. Jerome, motivated by the Church’s traditional faith in Mary’s perpetual virginity, wrote a tract against Helvidius (A.D. 383) in which he developed an explanation . . . that is still in vogue among Catholic scholars.”
Mark 3:31-35, JB: “His mother and brothers now arrived and, standing outside, sent in a message asking for him. A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him, ‘Your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you’. He replied, ‘Who are my mother and my brothers?’ And looking round at those sitting in a circle about him, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers. Anyone who does the will of God, that person is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Here a clear distinction is drawn between Jesus’ natural brothers and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. No one claims that the reference to Jesus’ mother means anything different from what it says. Is it consistent, then, to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins? When what is meant is not brothers but relatives, a different Greek word [syg•ge•non´] is used, as at Luke 21:16.)",0

 I'm not 100% sure what the practice is on sorting subcategories within their parent category.  I just checked, and I noticed that Category:Historic districts in Massachusetts has the pipe character and then """"Districts"""" after it, so it sorts into """"Districts"""" when you're browsing by letter.  That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the """"D"""" listings, to see the historic district subcategory.  That sort of makes sense, but it still doesn't get it listed on the first page.
 The reason I created the subcategory for houses is because there are over 3400 entries in Category:National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts, which is absolutely huge.  I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.  Eventually, I'm hoping to set up the infobox generator to check the historic function of the property, so if the function is listed as """"Single Dwelling"""" (code """"01A""""), it'll automatically put the property into the houses category.
 Speaking of the infobox generator, I finally had time to implement two of the changes you suggested.  I fixed the bug where seconds of latitude were being listed as 60, and I added the """" | coord_parameters = region:US_type:landmark"""" parameter.

"""*Support but change disambiguation - If I can interject, I'd like to add that I can see good arguments raised by both sides in this discussion from what I have read so far. 

The current title used has a natural disambiguation, which is always preferable in an article name and obeys WP:TITLE and WP:NATURAL. I don't wish to make a statement without any evidence to support it, but where I come from, everyone knows what the term 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' means and what it represents so it's not unpopular. The acronym 'ISIL' is also accurate enough to represent the group. That being said, I have started to notice that both these terms are being displaced by 'ISIS', 'Islamic State' and 'IS' in publications that I read, and news that I tune in to. Many reliable sources are also starting to refer to it as 'Islamic State' with many many different variants. The other fact that also should be considered here is the actual wording in the name. 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' makes the group sound as if it is geographically locked in these two regions, with no territory or ambition to spread outside of its primary spheres of influence. Similar to the Taliban-controlled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. And, dare I say, it also makes them sound more legitimate as a group then just the ambiguous 'Islamic State' designation, due to the emphasis placed upon the areas of 'Iraq and the Levant'. Makes it sound more formal. But it is now not the case. As multiple editors have stated, it is not merely a parochial militant group with territory in the regions of Iraq, Syria and now even parts of Lebanon but a transnational entity bent on expansion. I cannot see how relegating it to two geographic positions is the mature thing to do in an Encyclopedia, whatever the intention. It is becuase of this that I do not believe the current name and its disambiguation is viable anymore, purely for this reason. Some editors had stated the potential and very real problem of justifying 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' territory outside of Iraq and the Levant. It's not a recognized entity as far as I know. You cannot liken it to the Russian Federation having territory outside of Russia in Europe e.g Kaliningrad or the United States having territory outside of North America e.g Hawaii. What I am getting at is that this implies a level of legitimate ownership, and this group doesn't have it. Not in Libya or Yemen or Iraq or Syria or anywhere.

The issue I have with """"Islamic State (IS)"""" is the disambiguation which, whilst being a widely used acronym for the group, can not be measured accurately to satisfy WP:COMMONAME through Google searches alone. Even though many sources use 'IS' which has been stated, on its own as a disambiguation, it is simply too generic. A similar issue arises with the term """"Islamic State"""". However, were you to isolate the period for a search, the results would become more accurate, and this has already been stated. If a more appropriate disambiguation were to be found that could in concise terms explain what the article is about, I would support it. I suggest something along the lines of Islamic State (organisation) or Islamic State (ISIS) or Islamic State (group) or Islamic State (militant group). I am under the impression that WP:OFFICIAL and WP:COMMONAME are the important policies here, as editor  stated, and in my opinion the current title doesn't satisfy either, whilst a proposed title has the potential to satisfy both. 

The only reason why I choose to support this current proposal, is that progress towards a better article name will emerge allot quicker were it 'Islamic State (IS)' vs. a proposed alternative rather than the current title vs. a proposed alternative.

Fair use rationale for Image:Five-Star-Between-The-Lines-257547.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Five-Star-Between-The-Lines-257547.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

Hi, before you go too mad with these list of professional players, please be aware that the mentioning of them in the various Lancs cricket club articles will not assist in proving notability. Notability is not """"inherited"""" from things/people connected to the subject of an article: the clubs need to be able to demonstrate that in their own right, per WP:N.

 I'm not pretending anything and what I did is not """"mass deletion"""" - it's replacement of POV material with reliable sources. Before my latest edit, the Shlomo Argov edit did not even make sense - it couldn't, since the latter half of the paragraph that completed the first one was removed and replaced by something unrelated. What's more, all the material inserted by me today - about Israel's casus belli and the UN's commission's finding that Israel was responsible for the massacre - was there before my latest edits and only got removed, possibly by POV-motivated authors, this month. You can see both edits were already there months ago. Both edits are well sourced and, after a cursory look at the editing history, it can be seen whoever removed them did not give an explanation for their actions. The casus belli edit has as a source David Hirst's book about Lebanese history. The book was widely reviewed on mainstream media, and praised. It sits at the top of Wikipedia's reliable source chain. And even though this isn't required, the book is excerpted to show it supports the edit's content. In case anyone's in doubt, several other sources give support to Hirst's narrative.

I would be surprised since she told me that she put it here.  I suppose it could be possible.  I made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site.  It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki's personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.  At any rate, the reason we have guidelines, such as Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided, is to give us guidance in such instances.

While speaking via a loudspeaker and wearing a red coat, in front of a physician's home which the Israelis intended to bulldoze, Corrie fell down. A bulldozer then ran over her twice. Later, as a group of people gathered, a man was shot and killed by the Israel Defence Forces. 

Corrie was a senior at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.""""

A week after she was killed:
""""Rachel Corrie (1979 - March 16, 2003) was an American peace activist who was crushed to death while attempting to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer in a Gaza Strip refugee camp.

Corrie grew up in Olympia, Washington, and graduated from Capital High School. She had been a senior at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, where she studied the arts and international relations. She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.

Friends describe Corrie as athletically slender with blond hair and thoughtful, intelligent eyes. She played soccer, gardened and loved the poems of Pablo Neruda. She was the daughter of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie, a school volunteer and flutist.""""

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

For a certain editor
""""In 1952 BMW in West Germany produced its first car since before the Second World War. The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.

These cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coupé, known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”""""

Extract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle

But then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.

""""The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, “das rollende Ei” or “the rolling egg” The Isetta’s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.

Steering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn’t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.""""

 A request... 

Just completed the latest lesson for the VC.  Would you proofread/edit it please?

BTW, I've looked over your contributions again.  Your participation in deletion debates is good.

The main objection in your RfA was """"Lack of policy experience"""".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask '''''""",0

The phrase 'It distorts economies because it punishes productive people for being productive' in relation to progressive taxation does rather assume that people who are more productive get paid more. This does not neccesarily hold true, even if production is defined as contribution to the creation of wealth. It is certainly not true if production is defined as the creation of value.

In addition, the adjectives distort and punish seem rather emotive. It can be argued that people paying higher rate taxes have a duty to contribute to the economy and nation more than others. (such as one-nation toryism)

To follow up, I am very sympathetic indeed to your project to add the names of distinguished biologists and biological educators. If you'll check what I do around here, you'll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects.  But there are some difficulties. I can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on John Tyler Bonner was nominated about 6 months ago for speedy deletion as """"did not assert notability"""" and fortunately rescued. About one member of the US National academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at AfD a month. They all get kept, but it takes work. 

What is needed for a successful article on a researcher is:
A short bio listing the birth, degrees, positions. 
A paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as important
A list of books, & a few major articles. When challenged, I add the number of citations for the most-cited. 
A list of awards and honors and editorships . 
I've been adding grants received. 
if possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier  after they have died. 
and of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site, tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. 
Pictures, as you've discovered, add problems. I usually dont try. 
This works if: the person was a full professor at a recognized research university, and has an award or  two from outside the university. Otherwise there are problems; people at non-research places need very solid documentation. Professors of education need really solid documentation. 
 
For educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition, and at least one more than the president of NABT will in general be necessary.

The inclusion of 'high-accuracy' was a reluctant compromise, following the suggestion by Paine for 'fair-accuracy'. My approach is to remove calculus entirely from mention, given that there is no supporting evidence that it does anything remotely close to solving the paradoxes  when considering the infinite orders of magnitudes below the Planck length, that calculus spans, but which cannot be proved via experimental evidence as being at all relevant.

So, what proof do you have that calculus actually tracks the movement of physical things? None, beyond some crude classical approximations. Perhaps then the article should reflect that fact. Please feel free to replace 'high-accuracy' with low, or rough, or crude, take your pick.

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there.

I find that ridiculous. For example, BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7, 1965, to reach the charts (May 8). Highway 61 got out much quicker, with a one-month lapse from its August 20 release before charting. Going back earlier, Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin', more about than three months,  Using mid-July, then, means giving BoB  two weeks to debut, which is absurd. Of course, the whole problem centers on what is meant by """"release."""" In this case, it's being used to mean distribution, which was obviously delayed in BoB's case. However, the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that: pressing, packaging and promotion.

Margot then replies that she doesn't use that word lightly. I've always interpreted him calling her to discuss the review as implying that it was her review, and given her obvious sensitivity towards the word genius due to Etheline's use of it during Margot's upbringing it makes sense that she would specifically call someone not a genius were she to write a review.

I can't understand Jeffro77's first objection. Nowhere do I see a claim in the text that anyone other than the committee are the authors of their translation. The committee do announce explicitly that a privilege was granted to them. They are not thanking men for this. We have to adopt a scrupulously NPOV in quoting the donor of that privilege. It is a notable item of Jehovah's belief that all the books of the Bible have a single author in contrast to mainstream Christianity that acknowledges a number of authors at different times. But I choose to say """"a heavenly Author, not the heavenly Author, to avoid getting into loaded and POV consideration of that Author being unique or not. Capitalising the """"A"""" in Author is, I think, a reasonable concession to the same convention of capital """"G"""" for God, and """"Author"""" is true to the source. In case you still disagree, let's invite more voice(s) to help.

To Jeffro77's second objection, it is clear that Jeffro77 takes """"inspired"""" to mean """"divinely informed"""" and that Jeffro77 deduces from known dates of publication, that Jehovah's Witnesses include their own translation NWT among the 1 300 or 1 800 uninspired ones. I have no argument against that logic. However it may be too near WP:SYN because the Jehovah's Witnesses may not intend or even be aware of that argument's logic. Unless someone provides an source that says explicitly that the NWT is among the uninspired translations, we may not generate our own criticism this way. However the categorical claim by Jehovah's Witnesses about a remarkably large number of translations on which various faiths rely is notable in our survey of criticism of the NWT. Can this be said better?   """,0

Where is the information of Britney being a no-show at the Allure Mag's interview? Where is the information of her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?   Where is the information of Britney's former bodyguard speaking out? Where is the information of her being under the influence? Where is the information of Britney spending more time partying (with Paris Hilton, nonetheless) than being with her kids or concentrating on her music career? What about the fact that she was seen without underwear, more than once? All of us KNOW why Britney mangled her VMA performance! She was seen partying in Las Vegas 2 days in a row than focusing on getting her performance right!

"Alpa Discucssion expansion 

Hi SimonP

I'm the author of most of the discussion on Alpa cameras.

I'm wondering what you'd like expanded.  

I had edited the Alpa subject to include information about the Japanese Alpa cameras.  Someone else edited my text to indicate these cameras had no connection to the actual Swiss Alpa company.  According to my information, this was incorrect - after citing a book I feel is reliable, and waiting a week for rebuttal, I corrected the main Alpa page, and incorporated references.

I'm new to this, so hopefully I'm following protocol.

Wow! It has been over a year since I have posted anything here on Wikipedia and for that I am truly sorry! No, I am not dead nor is my lovely Packard Bell Legend 140CDT Supreme. I have been very busy and just have not had much time for play, only work. All work and no play makes owning a computer a bit dull so I have decided to make a dedication to posting here more often to help enhance the Wikipedia community's knowledge of Packard Bell and what good computer systems they really are. I am getting very excited as Thanksgiving is just right around the corner. Normally I post every year on Thanksgiving but last year, I did not get the chance to do so. Things will be different this year, I promise that! Thanksgiving would have to be my very favorite holiday of all time. I just feel so thankful to have such a great family and a great computer. 15 years later, my Packard Bell runs just as good as the day I bought it back in September of 1995! I recently had to upgrade my Internet browser from Microsft Internet Explorer version 5 to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5! I was having trouble as certian websites would not view correctly in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5. Many of my favorite websites came out too distorted to even use correctly so I am very grateful that Microsft supports up to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 on Microsoft Windows 95 as I will never upgrade my operating system! Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 works much better and for that I am truly grateful! People must understand that Packard Bell computers are the best around, no questions asked! I plan to continue running my Packard Bell Legend 140CDT Supreme until either I die or my computer dies, wichever comes first. I look forward to spending more time here serving the Wikipedia community and want to let everyone know that I am sorry and will make a commitment to be around more to spread the word about how good Packard Bell is! God bless you all and may the force be with you!

"Cavalist team of sysops/users undermines WP’s reliability  promoting Greek nationalistic POV 
A well collaborated group of 2 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related  new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. 

Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. 

All  redirects don’t  allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and  prevents recreating them under same name.

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  
I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  
IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  
1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

 """"British Isles"""" 

Hi. Thanks for your note; I assure you that the detailed explanations you offered weren't necessary — for somebody who doesn't live in Ireland or in the UK, I think I have an excellent knowledge of the region.

Where I differ from you is in my understanding of the word """"British."""" To my ears, """"British Isles"""" is an ancient and 'unmarked' (to use some linguistics terminology) phrase; to my ears, the anamalous thing is the use of the adjective """"British"""" as though it were the proper adjective for the United Kingdom. It's not; when used as such it's imprecise shorthand. You call the phrase """"British Isles"""" Victorian; but of course it is much older than that; and the ancient origins of all this terminology vastly predates the modern political situation (even if we define """"modern"""" as meaning """"the past millennium"""").

The deeper question, of course, is whether you have a terminological objection or a geographical one— do you object merely to the phrase """"British Isles""""; or do you object to the whole notion that these particular islands can be considered together as a set? Because, see, I think it's pretty obvious at a geographical level (far before humans arrived to hurt each other's feelings) that the islands can reasonably be considered a group. But once we consider them as a group, we have to call them something. I don't think any alternative to """"British Isles"""" has much currency.

I understand that for some Irish people the phrase rankles; but if they think that the phrase, when used by people from the UK, is full either of arrogance or ignorance or triumphalist glee, I'm quite confident they're mistaken in thinking so. Certainly in the rest of the world, outside those two countries, """"British Isles"""" is a phrase used constantly and frequently by well-educated people who are fully aware of the two countries / two islands involved, and who have no emotional investment in their sometimes strained history.  |  talk """,0

Thank you so much for the barnstar, I appreciate it!  It means a lot coming from you, but you are much more deserving of one! 

As for the water, I chose that because I've had problem finding the proper article myself.  I was doing a chemistry assignment and the regular Water article wasn't as comprehensive as Water (properties).  But then I found out we even had articles on Water_(data_page) and Color of water, which would have been very helpful had I known they existed.
But we also don't have an outline for water, so it may be better to demo a well developed outline.  If you have any good ideas, just go ahead and change it as you see fit.   """,0

BI: I am not biased, spamy, incorrect, or defiant.  CNTs are not required to build all space tethers - only those that are as long as an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator.  There are space tethers in orbit right this very minute that are made with existing materials.  Even the Boeing report that you have quoted says they are possible with existing materials.  Is there an upper limit to the length that a practical space tether can be built with existing materials?  Yes there is.  The overall upper length limit for a non-rotating skyhook that is still economically worthwhile is probably around 5,000 km.  To the best of my knowledge no one has gone to the trouble of actually determining that upper limit simply because by the time we build one that long there will be better materials that will allow us to build an even longer one.

A good example of this is suspension bridges.  About the longest you can build a practical suspension bridge using steel cable is a tad over one mile.  They have since made longer ones using carbon fiber cables.  But even carbon fiber cables are not strong enough to build a suspension bridge across the Strait of Gibraltar.  It is all a matter of degree.  

With current materials we can build a non-rotating skyhook up to about 5,000 km in length if we push it.  But we don't need to build one that long to make affordable space flight a reality.  A 2,200 km long non-rotating skyhook will have a lower endpoint velocity of 80% of orbital velocity for that altitude, and an upper endpoint velocity of 91% of escape velocity for its altitude.  Such a skyhook combined with a reusable single stage sub-orbital launch vehicle and the Orion spacecraft would give us affordable access to Earth orbit and all of near Earth space.  Space tourism, asteroid mining, satellite solar power stations, and space colonies would all become possible with such a system.

 Clarification on Wikipedia naming standards 

Hi Kohikoi,

You just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. I would like to remind you that Wikipedia:Administrator_Code_of_Conduct | Wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...

threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block
admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others

To deal with your concerns though. From my tandpoint I just corrected a breach of Wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. However,you just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a long-standing consensus between several users. Do you have evidence of this consensus? (i.e Where exactly is it reported on Wikipedia?) As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states... 

""""This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.""""

Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...

Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Pic
What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top? It's current, and it's a much better picture. Sure, the top one is more real, but it's a little too real. Like, just rolled out of bed, poured some beer on his cheerios and walked out to get the paper kind of real. When I brought this page up, I said, """"Yikes! That guy is uglier than Roger Moore!"""" The Bond pic does him justice, though.  
I'd rather leave it as is. Alternatively you could find a better image to replace the """"roll out of bed"""" picture.  
No problem, just figured I'd run it past you. I'm sure if there were any public domain photos of him out there that are more flattering, a better Bond fan than me would have found one by now. Happy editing!

It's correct, but I wouldn't say Lazenby had an era at all.

Introduction to US audiences
I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?  

I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.  
I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.  

While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

Actually, I don't think it's particularly 'enlightening' at all!  First, the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from 'the same person'.  I view that implication as an example of a 'straw-man argument':  A person builds up an (intentionally weak or flawed) argument, solely for the purposes of knocking it down.  That's not particularly enlightening, except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they've built it up, specially, just for that purpose.
I view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self-selection:  Consider that if you're at the top of El Capitan (natural rock pillar), you will find (generally) two types of people:   1.  Very rich people who can (and do) hire a helicopter to fly there.
2.  Very capable, enthusiastic, and competent rock climbers.
In other words, you don't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped, merely because of where you happen to be.  (and, if you're actually there, chances are that you, too, are either rich or a very good rock climber.  Wikipedia is, quite likely, a 'magnet' for 'control freaks'.  (and others, obviously.)  I've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits.  While I could say, """"Get a life!"""", I don't view such enthusiasm as INHERENTLY bad, wrong, or a problem.  But, I think there may very well be an ASSOCIATION between OCD-type (Obsessive-compulsive disorder) editing, and 'control-freak' behavior.
There are other clues that must be considered.  A person who is acting out a 'control-freak' fantasy, wants to control as much as possible.  Apparently, WP has made it quite easy to 'revert'  to a previous edit.  That ability is not NECESSARILY bad (against vandals), but it implicitly encourages a kind of 'all or nothing' reaction:  If a 'control-freak' wishes to manipulate, as much (and as many) as possible, it's far easier to simply 'revert' ALL of an edit, rather than (carefully and selectively) remove ONLY as much of a 'problem' as actually exists.  Ever heard an old saying, """"When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails.""""  One of the most 'inefficient' routes, from the standpoint of a 'control-freak', is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit, and the characteristics of the 'control-freak's actions. 
A 'control-freak' gets his jollies, most readily, by UNdoing what others have done.  (The 'control-freak' feels, explicitly or implicitly, that he doesn't have to 'justify' the status of the article BEFORE his victim's edit!).  If the 'control freak' must actually distinguish between 'proper' posting and 'improper' posting sections, he becomes far less 'efficient' at manipulating others.  (He must spend far more 'valuable' (in his not-so-humble opinion) time READING, and distinguishing, rather than merely reverting!   Consider a hypothetical 'war' between a person who is making a 'house of cards', and another person who views it as his task to impede the first:  The latter person needs merely show up for a second or two, every few minutes, and knock down the 'house of cards'.  Minutes or hours of work is gone, in a moment!  VERY 'efficient', from the standpoint of the 'control freak', but not for his victim.
 Worse, if the 'control freak' must first obtain a CONSENSUS (something which WP ostensibly requires) he is powerfully impeded from excercising his 'control-freak' tendencies.  (I am not considering, here, raw 'vandalism', of course:  Very arguably, it SHOULD be easy to completely revert actual, genuine 'vandalism'.)  It is not surprising, therefore, that 'control-freaks' are far more likely to simply revert ALL of an edit, QUICKLY, preventing consensus, and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion.
Thus, I notice that (in, so far, every case), every 'drive-by deletion' to which I have been a victim involves a person who REVERTS ALL of my edits (Check!), and not merely a portion of them (Check!) and who does so VERY quickly (Check!), who prevents any sort of consensus from forming (Check!), and who doesn't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting, or the 'freak's' abrupt erasures (Check!).
  Aha!  Things are getting quite clear, at least from the standpoint of the 'control-freak' in question.  But why should a flock of others try criticize the victim, and NOT the 'control freak'?  Is it because I think 'they're the same person'?  ('Straw-man argument')   Noooo!  Consider another saying, """"Birds of a feather flock together"""".   If there were only a single 'control-freak' in the world, nobody else would have any motivation to assist him, or to help victimize his victims.  But there are many 'control-freaks', and each understands that if ONE 'control freak' gets impeded, prohibited, or criticized, or exposed, the next one COULD BE THEM!  After all, I",0

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a """"see also"""" pointing to the other page.

 Following the move, the college began to offer a number of Theology and Education

 When this was scrapped following the 1992 Education Act, the college entered an

 read for degrees of the University.

 Your meddling immigrant confusion... 

I have a source here that explains the ethnic origins of American Founding Fathers:

http://www.greatseal.com/committees/firstcomm/index.html

(English, Scottish, Irish, French, Dutch/Orangist, German/Holy Roman coats of arms)

That being said, Rhenish Germans were the sort we had in those days.  Prussians and Austrians, as well as their politics, did not constitute part of the Founding Fathers' vision or hope of the future for America.  You'll have an impossible time convincing educated people that the Habsburg or Hohenzollern (except perhaps Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben) politics in any way were an inspiration for Americans of any or all origins, then and now.  We have had emulation of William van Oranje-Nassau and Prince Rupert of the Rhine including his family such as the Winter King and Queen of Bohemia, but that is because they were Rhenish and any other Palatine (Amish etc., like Herbert Hoover and Dwight Eisenhower) culture we pretty much supported always and for all times.  That's different from the East German culture, which has never, ever been a component of Americana and might never be either.  Try to prove otherwise to any academic historian and they will laugh in your face.  You have to put the German issue in context; Benjamin Franklin was hostile to """"Palatine Boors"""" as he called them, but the Quaker establishment which founded Pennsylvania loved him to death.

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

"Another episode (Emily and her dog) 

Here is another story about Emily and her dog:
Emily was a remarkable creature. As a child and as a woman, she was in person a mere shadow of humanity, — pale, and delicate. But a wild unearthly spirit dwelt within her, and ever and again it flashed forth through her eyes in a fashion that made beholders tremble. When a child she was bitten by a strange dog, and without saying a word she went to the kitchen, took a red-hot Italian iron from the fire, and laid it on the wounded part. Her pet and constant associate was a huge, tawny, ferocious bull-dog, that some eccentric friend had given her. Every one in the house stood in awe of this brute; it persisted in lying at full length on the clean counterpanes of the beds, but no one save its mistress dared teach it better manners, for it was known never to forgive a blow. Emily, however, resolved to flog the monster. She was small, slight, feeble, and a child in years; but with whitened face, and flashing eyes, she seized the dog by the back of the neck and dragged it down stairs; on reaching the hall, she let go her hold, and instantly the furious creature flew at her throat, but promptly, with her little clenched fist, she struck it in the eye and knocked it back; a quick succession of blows followed — every one of them being directed against the one or the other eye. The battery lasted for several minutes, when the animal fell down stupified, blinded, and senseless; and Emily dragged off its huge carcase in triumph, to foment the swollen eyes. The dog loved her, with a dog's lasting, slavish love, ever afterwards lived obedient to her call, and when she died mourned as weakly as a human creature over her grave.

FROM THE TIMES

""""The sudden loss of pressure in an airliner cabin, as occurred on the Ryanair flight, is a frightening and potentially painful experience for passengers but it is does not usually endanger the aircraft. Half a dozen episodes of rapid pressure loss have been suffered by airliners over the past year.

Pilots follow a standard procedure if the cabin pressure suddenly drops while at cruising altitude. They don the oxygen masks which are constantly at their shoulder and put the aircraft into an emergency descent to about 8,000ft above sea-level, the altitude at which the air becomes comfortably breathable.

At the same time the crew would have declared an emergency to the en-route air traffic control and requested immediate clearance to the lower altitude and landing at a nearby airport. In the meantime the oxygen masks will have deployed automatically to supply passengers and other crew during the descent.

The Ryanair Boeing 737 performed exactly this procedure after it suffered pressure loss. The pilots descended from about 35,000ft to 8,000ft in five minutes, according to the authorities at Limoges airport, where it landed. The media and passengers may call such manoeuvres a """"plunge"""" or a """"free fall"""", but the descent rate of about 5,600ft per minute is perfectly controlled and within the normal performance of the aircraft — assuming that all its flight systems are functioning.""""""",0

Since the dawning of the Internet, gossip can be disseminated around the world with the simple push of a button. 

Our First Amendment gives us the right to start a blog and publish whatever we wish to say about anybody.  It is much easier to be critical than correct. 
 
The freedoms we enjoy in the U.S are wonderful but they are also very dangerous. To create an unfavorable impression, it is not necessary that what is said be true.  The damage is done in the mere telling of it.  No one has felt that sting more than I. Last year, the Mail On Sunday falsely reported Andrew Morton paid me to dig up dirt on Tom Cruise, which could not be further from the truth.  The editors finally got around to making the correction.

 Traditional or Simplified Chinese? 

I've moved this to a new section because it has become difficult to continue two topics in the same section. I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus. 

Why are we still including both sets in these articles?

Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other? This doesn't have anything to do with anyone's personal views on """"one china"""" or """"two chinas"""", but rather is an issue of reflecting the language situation in both areas and cleaning up articles.

Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use """"not censored"""" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers.

Talk:Female genital mutilation; please stop
Hi Elvey. I noticed you on Johnuniq's page, which I watch, and was moved to check out the discussion at Talk:Female genital mutilation. Your part of it worried me. While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics, as FGM is not a field I've studied, I see two principles in play on that talkpage, that are true for all articles, and that you seem to pay scant attention to: 

1) Use reliable secondary sources. It's important (for all articles, but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM) to be based on reliable secondary sources. Synthesising sources in order to argue, in Wikipedia's voice, with a UNICEF report from 2013 isn't on, unless you have a reliable source (as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources) that offers the same argument. 
2) Consensus. Nobody (except partly Vetrisimino0) agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. There is consensus against your section tags, described here as """"overly aggressive"""". I hope the issue of the tags has blown over, but a few days ago you kept restoring them, and defend them aggressively; the fact that the article is being prepped for WP:FAC seems to anger you further, and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WP:OWN: a serious accusation, which shouldn't be made without good evidence, and which you have taken to SV's user talkpage as well.

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you, as far as I can see; you're the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this, where you call Zad's comment """"blatantly untrue, not to mention insulting"""" — based, as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done (he wasn't). That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people, """"eggshells armed with hammers"""" (Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships). Please don't jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. Worse, your header here is a noxious bad-faith-assuming personal attack, something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin, which you had moved there from your own talkpage. That is truly awful behaviour, seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. (Charming edit summary at your own page, btw.) If you can't stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever you're contradicted (this post, aggressively attacking Johnuniq, is a charming recent example), I advise you to take a break from the article. That's advice. What I tell you, as an uninvolved admin, is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before, and you must stop attacking people. Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is """"abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute"""", currently at the bottom of the page, is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see. Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin, or warned you in any way? If I've missed where SV is playing the admin card, tell me where. The word """"disrupt"""", which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation, is by no means _ the prerogative of admins.  | talk .

I appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at FGM by taking the discussion here.  I wish you'd participate in the discussion of the facts instead.  I feel that in coming here, you raise/reiterate some good points, but I don't think you should be raising the first few, at least, here:

 You cannot say that """"Tamil Nadu is more crime-oriented than Goa because TN is #3 on the list, far ahead of Goa."""" If the population of Goa is 10 times less than that of TN, it won't be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in TN as opposed to only 100 in Goa. Delhi and Mumbai are the most populous cities in India, so it's not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities.

 """"If so then even London is capital of UK does it mean crimes in London could be ignored?""""

Perhaps we should work on that section here.  Here's the text, which I've started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.
Oh, and the page should probably be all Harvard refs, rather than none:  Wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author.    

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

"Free Software example 

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument. It would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.",0

 Inappropriate tone 
The following comment seems inappropriate, given its placement in the article:
""""On the other hand, in Maya rituals prisoners of war were in fact killed 'on top of the pyramid […] by having his arms and legs held while a priest cut open his chest with a sacrificial flint knife and tore out his heart as an offering.'""""

That would be a perfectly fine thing to say if the previous sentence were something like """"The portrayal of human sacrifice in the film has been criticized as inaccurate.""""  But the previous sentence is: """"The film has been accused of fueling a stereotype of native Mesoamericans as bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements other than architecture.""""  By offering the human sacrifice description as an """"on the other hand"""" the implication is that civilizations that practiced such human sacrifice were actually """"bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements"""".  That's blatantly POV and inappropriate.

I suggest either (A) deleting the offending sentence, (B) moving it to a portion of the article that discusses human sacrifice in particular, or (C) adding a sentence prior to it quoting some specific criticism of the films portrayal of human sacrifice.   

A sentence prior to it would be fine; there should be something out there that contains criticism. — (talk • contrib) - 

 Inaccurate inaccuracies 
Read on the current Inaccuracies section:
""""And the Spanish arriving at the end of the movie came a little too soon, as they actually arrived during the reign of the Aztec Empire, which succeeded the Maya.""""

That sentence had no sense. The Aztecs never conquered or killed off the Mayas. The Mayas where in fact the first Mesoamerican people who encountered the Spaniards on land - around 1510 - and the Spaniards actually knew about the Aztecs from the Mayas.

""""The diseased little girl is often regarded as having smallpox. However, smallpox did not arrive in the Americas until the early 16th century with the Spanish Conquistadores. As the disease is not called by a modern name we cannot be sure what the intention was.""""

As there are Spaniards in the movie, it's sure that the movie doesn't take place before the 16th century. However, you can't guarantee what is the exact year. They are Spaniards, but they have not to be the first Spaniards in the Yucatan, just the first in the lands of the Mayan city-state that is shown in the movie. Spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the Yucatan and infect the people there, and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. The Southern Ming never visited Europe, but their Black Plague destroyed 1/3 of the European population, and the Incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in Mexico extended to South America and killed the emperor and his heir. I suppose that you understand what I'm trying to say. The girl with smallpox it's just another element to support the idea that the end of the Mayan civilization is coming 

Why do you assume that they in the Yucatan?  Others make that jump based on the dialect that the director choose to use.  If language in the movie is the only thing that ties where the story takes place to the Yucatan then I would argue that Gibson only used the dialect because it is still a living language used by many of the extras in the cast.  I cannot see anything else in the film that cements the idea that this was a movie about the Maya in the Yucatan.  RDG""",0

Both are not the same, they can not be the same, and no article about other peoples which would be neutral will use such a connection. An identity which did not exist at the time can not become existent because you can connect it with an ancestry. This does not make sense; we can then even claim the British and Germans to be the same.

You did the same mistake on the Azeris in Turkey, which is basically full of original research… how on Earth could Turkic people having moved in what is now Turkey before the identity be considered as Azerbaijanis? From the same token, over half the Turks could be called Azerbaijani. Like you said yourself, we are not going to waste our time, I request a RFC on this article, and do you accept? -",0

QUOTE:
Several mechanisms have been proposed where warmth builds up in the equatorial area, then is dispersed to higher latitudes {NORTH?] y an El Niño event. [WHAT MECHANISMS? HOW IS BUILD-UP AND DISPERSAL RELEVANT??]

The cooler area [WHERE IS THAT?] then has to """"recharge"""" warmth for several years before another event can take place.[citation needed]

The Madden-Julian Oscillation is not a cause of the phenomena, but propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle on the order of 30-60 days, and may significantly influence the speed of development and intensity of El Niño and La Niña. 2.

Tropical cyclones north and south of the equator that may play a role in ENSO are caused by the westerly flow between the areas of low pressure induced by a Madden-Julian oscillation.[4] [WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??]

Such wind may counteract the typical easterly flows across the Pacific and create a tendency toward continuing the eastward motion.[citation needed] [A COUNTERACTION OF EASTERLY FLOWS CREATES TENDENCY TOWARD EASTWARD MOTION??]

Eastward-propagating oceanic Kelvin waves can be produced by Madden-Julian activity, which may in turn be influenced by a developing El Niño, leading to a positive feedback.[5] [HOW IS THIS PRODUCED, HOW IS THIS INFLUENCED?}

"Where to put full versions of abbreviated citations 

Re this edit, which I mostly reverted. I've run into similar problems elsewhere, where a few works are cited many times, and it's useful to collect the the full citations into a section, and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.",0

The first V-8 engine of record was not A De Dion-Bouton but was the Antoinette V-8 of 1903
Antoinette had a 180 degrees crankshaft did all others until Wright, who was making the Hispano-Suiza of 718 cu. In. and 1124 cu. in. in about 1918 or a later wanted to put the 90 degree crankshaft into the 1124” engine but the Navy and the Army Air Corp wanted air cooled Radials so this left it up to Cadillac to do it in 1923. This is recorded in Manuel Lage’s book about Hispano-Suiza page 66, Line 10. 
http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2002/dec2.htm
That design came from a Frenchman with a background in art, Léon-Marie-Joseph-Clement Levavasseur (1863-1922). He started work on his new engine in about 1900. His engine had eight cylinders, but instead of putting them in a straight line, Levavasseur arranged them in the shape of a """"V."""" It was a powerful and compact design, and when he received a French patent on December 2, 1902, Levavasseur became the first person to patent what we now call a V-8 engine.

http://www.hubertlathamwindkiller.com/Monoplane.htm

The Antoinette engine was designed and built in France by Léon Levavasseur. Named after the designer's daughter, it was Europe's most widely used engine until 1909-1910. The first Antoinette engine dated from about 1901 and was used in a speedboat. By 1905, Levavasseur had produced a water-cooled engine with eight-cylinders arranged in a 90-degree """"V"""" and with direct fuel injection. It was safe, strong, and fairly powerful, generating 50 horsepower (37 kilowatts) and weighing about 110 pounds (50 kilograms). Its power-to-weight ratio was not surpassed for 25 years

Antoinette VII. Designed by Léon Levavasseur, who was an artist as well as a gifted engineer, the Antoinette range possessed an almost art nouveau sense of elegance. The engine, also named 'Antoinette', came first, being designed by Levavasseur in 1903 to power motor boats. Both Santos-Dumont and the Voisins used this engine to power their early machines. The motor was of advanced design, utilizing direct fuel injection and evaporative steam cooling - which took place in long tubes fixed along the sides of the fuselage.

Second things first. Non specifically, but we use {t1|Infobox Book}}.

Note on the criteria, for the current lists it is as stated. For the new proto list (up in 26 hours of this post) it will be very simple, are the hits correct, am I giving you guys articles that have complete infoboxes? I can guarrentee that all the articles will have an infobox... becuase I will be parsing the template category. The primary problem will be to seperate out novels from the books. (right now the code will give both) Remember this is a wiki... All I am doing is writing the code, this wikiproject needs to tell me what to do. (p.s. I want to start to have conversations on one of our forums (WP:NOVEL talk page), rather than on our talk pages. Eagle talk

"Red Peacock - You are correct to think something is amiss. Xeno apparently only saw that portion of the interview in which Susan actively argues with the insane man holding the hitler picture (as if that alone wasn't unprofessional). Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke. Seriously – it’s really long but well worth the read.

 Agree  with User Humus above. And to answer your specific question on """"French Bolshevism"""": the number of Frenchmen in the Russian empire was practically zero.

That's what the phrase means, and nothing more. The purpose of this article is to document Antisemitism, and not to be Antisemitic like the Protocols of Zion.

 Third opinion 

Hey. So I've looked over the conversation here, and to be honest, I don't have any problem with the URL category. It doesn't really strike as spam since they all seem to fit the inclusion criteria. The links might be more gracefully included than just the standard numbered link - maybe have it say clearwiki.com and have the link - but it seems okay. Similarly, WP:NOTLINK doesn't apply here since there is a lot more meaningful data attached to the entries in the list.

As a side note, I think it would be most helpful to this article to either create articles for each of the entries on here, or at least give some references as to why they're notable. I personally don't see the Alexa criterion as making it notable, and instead I'd just fall on WP:WEB as a way of determining notability. —  (say whaaat?!) """,0

""" the mother carries her kittens. It should also point out that the behaviour links to mating as well. During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania.
Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criteria, but they are unambiguous in their position.

FGR#11 is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. A couple of things I noted. The table of p28 shows a good dozen elements (including Ca) where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on """"model"""" to the next. The following summary on p29  says: """"for about 70% of radionuclides, the differences are not substantial, ie., less than a factor of four. 

That points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. Also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test (which it is not , it's a model) . The magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of 4 is seen as """"not substantial"""" gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be.

 re:Image:AnotherVersionofthePast.jpg 

I saw your post to ^demon regarding this image. I cannot undelete the image because of WP:FUC #3.b. The image has not been reduced in size. I also believe it fails #2 in that it directly competes with the commercial opportunities of the copyright holder. #8 is also jumping out at me, because the summarized text in the article serves the same purpose as the image. There is not critical commentary about the design of the sight or visual representation of the image in the article Chronology of the Year Zero alternate reality game. Therefore, the exact image you uploaded isn't appropriate for use on wikipedia, and a cropped or reduced size image may theoretically be appropriate, but in the proposed article would just be decorative (and against out non-free content policy). Sorry, but I hope this explanation helps.- [talk] 
Thanks very much for the reply.  I understand your Fair-Use concerns, and hopefully I can address all of them.
FUC 3.b - Agreed.  If the image is undeleted I'd be happy to reduce it's size and upload the smaller version, but I can't really do that (download the high resolution version) until it is undeleted.
FUC #2 - There are no commercial opportunities at stake here.  Because of the odd nature of the website, as part of an alternate reality game, the only logical copyright holder would be either Nine Inch Nails, 42 Entertainment, or Interscope records.  No one is making any money off of these websites: in fact, they officially have absolutely no connection to any company, not even to the album (Year Zero (album)) that it is parallel to.  Reznor himself has stated the ARG is NOT a promotional device.  (see Year Zero (alternate reality game) for more info on that)
FUC #8 - Although the dates themselves are similar, the text is not.  The whole point of the originating website, Another Version of the Past is that there are multiple perspectives of past events.  The text in the WP article is a dry, point-for-point account: """"neutral"""" if you will.  The two versions of the time line presented on the website represent both extremes of the fictional issues at hand: pro-American, pro-government, etc and on the other hand extremist, rebellious, reformatory, etc.  The image provides the user an opportunity to see the POV/agendas at work and compare it to what actually happened.  For example the New Orleans floods are described as a """"Faith-based disaster"""" on one hand, and """"Why Bother with New Orleans?"""" on the other.  
I still believe the image wouldn't be appropriate here. The site the image came from is copyrighted, and was used to promote the album (for the record company executives), regardless what Reznor said, so FUC#2 still concerns me, and I'm not convinced of FUC#8 either. We can simply quote snippets of text without showing it if we want to discuss how the timeline is presented. We'd need to discuss visual aspects of how things look in order to show an image, IMO. I have asked another admin who is more versed in image policy to comment here, so be patient for a 2nd opinion. Thanks for your reply.- [talk] 

Greetings. I was asked to comment here. This image is essentially text, with decorative flourishes. As such, I don't see how  it could pass WP:NFCC#8, which requires that a non-free image provide encyclopedic information beyond what text alone could convey. I don't believe that the text alone, quoted, would be less informative than the image. (And I think that much text, quoted verbatim, would be a copyright violation, which is another indicator that this image isn't allowed.) All the best, –  (talk) (random) 
Ok, fair enough.  I know better than to argue with two admins. =)  Thanks for taking the time to review the case.

"The Malvern Water cure
For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. 

There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.

The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow",0

Reading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.  

The Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.

The Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.

The surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to """"... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.""""

Asking  for a discussion on returning the mention of Tong violence in the history section. The following sentences were deleted without a how-do-you-do, no talk page, no citation tag, no NPOV, nothing.

""""Not unlike much of San Francisco, a period of criminality ensued in some tongs on the produce of smuggling, gambling and prostitution, and by the early 1880s, the white population had adopted the term Tong war to describe periods violence in Chinatown, the San Francisco Police Department had established its so-called Chinatown Squad.

"GA Sweeps invitation
Hello, I hope you are doing well. I am sending you this message since you are a member of the GA WikiProject. I would like to invite you to consider helping with the GA sweeps process. Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.

We are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or  and we'll be happy to help. Happy editing!  (talk • contrib)",0

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic. I'm honestly, genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. I don't belong editing here on Wikipedia as I can't even approach your level of intelligence.

 """"The Modern Nation State and Regimes of Violence: Reflections on the Current Situation"""" . A recent paper on the subject by Kossler, a German academic writing for a Japanese audience. Pages 15-18 have a good summary of the history of the concept - Hobbs, Weber, Marx, etc. He views the """"monopoly on violence"""" as the result of the consolidation process which turned Europe from a collection of feudal regions into nation-states. Rather than trying to define """"legitimate"""" violence, Kossler speaks of the """"public dimension of violence"""".  Kossler also sees an economic dimension: """"The guarantee of sound market conditions therefore is also dependent on the  effective exercise of sovereignty by the state."""".  After covering the classic position, Kossler points out that non-state actors mess it up: """"The post-9/11 situation forces important and disconcerting qualifications on this rather conventional picture. This goes back to the fact that an act of outrageous violence emanating from a non-state source which cannot be defined in territorial terms has been interpreted as an act of war, to be countered by military means, including the targeting of certain state-bounded territories, such as Afghanistan and later Iraq."""" He also mentions the rise of """"networked organizations"""", including crime cartels that operate across borders, as challenging state monopolies on violence.
 In 2004, George Will wrote, about the US-Iraq war, """"The first task of the occupation remains the first task of government: to establish a monopoly on violence.""""  Because that effort wasn't successful, there's a lot of later material on what happens when the state can't establish a monopoly on violence. See also Arab Spring.

Concerning Mesić, this is not just one poll I am talking about, there were many. Every so often the news publish the results of the various agencies that researched this phenomenon. These polls do not, repeat, do not center on the capital. They are highly professional and reliable, and in each one, Mesić was voted the most popular. Need I also mention the ultimate poll of all? the presidential elections? two of them in fact, both of which he won as an independent candidate and did not rely on the support of any party. Furthermore, I find the idea that football hooligans represent the Croatian people highly offensive, as opposed to, for example, university students. I also do not know where you get the idea that the entire Croatian national football team is extreme right-wing, that is not the case.
I imagine you must have come into contact only with certain circles of Croatian society. Perković generally draws his support from the rather rural parts of Croatia, and from people that hail from such war-stricken and... undeveloped areas. Modern, pro-western central urban areas, far from supporting the Great Patriot Perković, are the source of the many recent protests against him. I've not known him on a personal level for years so I cannot say whether or not he really cares about the Croatian people. I do know that professing eternal love for the """"holy soil of Croatia"""" is absolutely essential for his cash flow, though. Quite frankly, I do not care about whether he really """"loves Croatia"""", all I know is that he is the public focal point of a backward nationalist mentality that has claimed far too many victims and destroyed far too many economies around here.

"""

 Meaning of the name in Czech  
I had to correct the following statement: """"The boy named Crow"""" (""""Kafka"""" means """"crow"""" in Czech).. 

In fact the Czech word for crow is vrána (cf. cs:vrána). The actual (and exact) meaning of kavka is jackdaw (a bird of Coloeus subgenus), specifically the Western Jackdaw (Coloeus monedula, cf. cs:kavka) In surnames the middle consonant occurs spelled v or f but pronunciation behind remains the same: . 

While jackdaws and crows (Corone subgenus) are similar closely related birds and visual misidentification sometimes occurs, the semantical border betwen jackdaw nad crow remains clearly drawn in the Czech language, at least when looking from the jackdaw side towards crows. Crows feature more prominently in common parlance (proverbs etc.) - therefore sometimes other crow-like birds (ravens etc.) are called simply crows, but on the other hand if one says kavka he/she certainly refers specifically to a jackdaw and doesn't mean vrána (either of two species native to the Czech lands - Carrion Crow Corvus corone or Hooded Crow Corvus cornix). 

Being unfamiliar with Japanese naming of the various Corvidae I hope this will help to clarify the naming issue at least from Czech perspective. Presumably that inaccuracy/oversimplification arose in chain of translation across several languages.   """,0

"""::: Cparker, I don't know what you did after 2006, but if anyone else has this kind of issue, I would suggest you consider the lap band instead. It does not require the drastic re-sectioning of your organs that is done in roux en y/gastric bypass. In the surgery, you lose more than a foot of your small intestine that you can't get back and that is necessary if it is connected to the stomach in its normal position; the area where that connection originally occurred is closed off by sutures; the area of your stomach that is stapled creates a bifurcated stomach that cannot be reopened - it is completely irreversible. This is a complete and permanent lifestyle and physiological change that should never be taken lightly. See my comments in other comment sections on this page about about the difference between your pre- and post-surgical life. You will be on a diet for life - you will not be returning to your prior eating habits, and as I mention above, you may not even want to. Your tastebuds will change. Your nutritional needs will be re-prioritized. You still have to actively pursue the weight loss - it isn't that they cut your stomach down and you eat what you want and lose weight - that is not how it works at all. You will be nauseated after the surgery - mine lasted for the two and a half months during which I was on pureed food only - I begged people to pray for me, it was so bad, but once I was back on solid food, it went away. That may have been unique to me. There are many problems that occur with everyone, but some will be unique to you. My program made me do 6 months of supervised 1,500 calorie a day diet and exercise (as much as I could with other conditions hampering me), and prior to that my PCP and I tried a similar program ourselves. So there is no """"trying it out"""" - you are either in the program or not. But I can tell you, after almost a decade of obesity caused by medications I take for other conditions (and to be honest, exacerbated by over-eating for the first time in my life, also a side-effect of those meds), I have lost about 55 lbs. in the 5 months since my surgery. Seeing the scale keep going down and down is a good feeling. With the surgery, it happens quickly at first and then slows down, with the lap band it's just the opposite. Make sure you are totally informed before you make a choice, and choose your surgeon and their program wisely. Do your homework. Plus, they have screening methods, also, to make sure you are not wasting their time. You will be given a psychological evaluation - similar to having plastic surgery - to make sure you understand the risks, the benefits, the amount of involvement you play in your weight loss journey, and if you are ready for it.

"Cozumel
I added a citation needed tag to information you added to the Cozumel concerning its recovery from Hurricane Wilma. Is this information that you got from a source, or from your firsthand observation? As I'm sure you're aware, Wikipedia requires that any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged must be accompanied by a reliable (published) source. The Wilma section of the Cozumel article has been challenged in the past, and is likely to be challenged again in the future with there being lots of people in the Scuba diving community who say Cozumel is great, fully recovered, and those saying it's still damaged or was irreparably harmed by Wilma.

There were two main reasons why I closed: The solid arguments WP:SALAT and WP:NOT#DIRECTORY. """"Keep - but remove red links"""" isn't really a solid rationale; it didn't really address the two arguments above. The second keep was stronger, but again didn't really address the points above, and was more along the lines of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. As We66er said, removing the redlinks would leave a list of five, which defeats the object of a """"list"""". On the counter side of that argument, redlinks show potential for new articles, but when there are so many redlinks, there is no need for such a list. There were many items on the list, yet only a handful were referenced, and as another said, one of the organisations on that list had been deleted previously through AfD. The strongest keep therefore was WP:STAND, but that was struck as a result of misinterpretation. This is the full reason for my close. However, deleting admins don't generally say any more than """"keep"""" or """"delete"""" in their closing statement, unless 1) there is a specific reason for the delete and/or 2) it was a decision that could cause controversy.

"Clearly you *haven't* read WP:NPA, otherwise you wouldn't have written this. It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less well-known brother's article and immediately feel the need to remove tags? The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite, not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a 'good friend' and a 'fan' of Marc Sinden from the age of 12(!), when they met on the set of the 'Hey Jude' video recording(!). Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucket-load of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sinden-related articles. Amazingly enough, this editor and their socks have added Marc Sinden's name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia. 130! For someone who's less notable than my goldfish!
It's certainly true that the Jeremy Sinden article might lead one here, because of course there are no less than *three* mentions/links to Marcus' page from there - sadly there is not one single link from Marcus' back to Jeremy's, indeed his name has been expunged completely from the Marc Sinden article. It seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor, instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of Jeremy's immediately! May I therefore suggest you take three actions? 
1. Go read WP:NPA yet again, just in case it hasn't impinged. 
2. Add links and content to the Marc Sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum Jeremy Sinden, because in all the puffery of Marc, poor Jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored. 
3. Expand the content of the Jeremy Sinden article such that it *at least* matches the Marc Sinden article, because it is a disgrace that the puffed-up Marc Sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the Jeremy Sinden article, when Jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable - go and put this right. 
Finally, as an observation; as a contemporary of Jeremy you would be around 60 years old - it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance, and the wisdom of seniors, that one might normally expect. May I suggest that you therefore refrain from further conflict and personal attacks, and put your editing efforts to work exclusively on the person you *do* know about? Thanks.",0

Take some time to look at other youth orchestra entries in Wikipedia. 
List of youth orchestras in the United States
Look at some that have clean up notices on them and look at some of the better ones. If you do this you will be better able to judge the content. 

You may use published sources that are not on-line. So long as they are reliable and ultimately verifiable by someone who would take the time to look them up to check the information.

Wikipedia has increased the need for Encyclopedic Value. Older articles that are not verifiable are being removed. The ones that have long standing clean up notices will either be rectified by interested parties or will ultimately be removed. Those notices serve to tell the public that the article does not meet the standards of reliability of an encyclopedic article. 

It appears that the Orchestra has been in existence for 50 plus years. It is not an emergency to get an article published. The heading ==Acclaim== jumps out as promotional. This is puffery and self aggrandizement. The article must be neutral in tone. The references or footnotes must back up statements in the article. for example use a statement such as - The orchestra has been well received by audiences in Country A and City B. Put in the references. the references themselves may be full of congratulatory language but avoid putting in the article. By way of illustration, if a news article from Country A said this is the greatest orchestra in the world and got a five minute standing ovation from the audience, you would use that as reference with regard to the aforementioned statement but would not put that directly in the article. If the article is in a venue brochure it is of little value but if it is in the Country A's leading newspaper then it is of value. Ask yourself, what would make this youth orchestra worthy of mention in an encyclopedia. That critical viewpoint will lead to a better article.",0

"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc). Ignorance must surely be bliss for these morons. Goodbye ye olde 'land of the free and the home of the brave'.""",0

 I think the harcourt article is excellent, both because it provides additional context (particular in regards to the '19 and '28 weimar law), and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument.  It is widely accepted (harcourt, library of congress) that the early laws were targeted directly against the Nazis, and other paramilitary groups that were threatening, and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. (The government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwI was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare). As late as '32 Heinrich Bruening attempted to ban the SA and SS (see rise and fall of the 3rd reich) (Ironically setting up the situation that enabled the Nazis to legally take control). The subsequent laws enacted by Hitler were to a) rearm the nazis, in particular the private army SAs. 2) ensure familiarazation of  the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. 3)ensure the  disarm all political opponents, specifically calling out jews.  Harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game - sure he disagrees with the NRAs use of nazi imagery in modern debate. Yes he says """"the nazi's were not in general pro gun control"""".  Both of those prior arguments are straw men, which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued - the core history which Harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to """"Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. The Nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons, including guns, from Jewish persons, and subsequently engaged in genocide of
the Jewish population"""" or """"To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide"""". Nobody disagrees that Hitler armed his private army (SA, party), while disarming the people he was about to exterminate. Harcourt discusses this directly as well, quoting The Nazi minister of the interior """"“If these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the National Socialist state possess any weapons, then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the Weapons Law for the population faithful to the state"""". To  (Saul)WP:FRINGE You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. (/Saul) What part is fringe? That the nazis implemented gun control? That the gun control specifically targeted Jews? That there are a plethora of memos, diaries, and documents saying """"Go attack the jews, they are disarmed so you shouldn't have any resistance""""? That the jews were later exterminated? Please identify the specific facts which you think are fringe.   """,0

While I take your recommendation to heart, I have to insist that, by any plain reading of WP:NFCC#1, the image is keepable.  Let's look at the test in NFCC #1 & evaluate this image:
Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose.
No free equivalent could be created to show what Berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at 16 or so no matter how we approach him as a 22-year-old anti-child pornography speaker & educator.  
If non-free content can be transformed into free material, this is done instead of using a fair-use defense.
The only way I could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask Berry to permit its release under GFDL.  Permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be (to my mind) cruel even to ask Berry about it.
Non-free content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. """"Acceptable quality"""" means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose.
There is no freer equivalent available  Berry will never be a teenager again, and, since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics, letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent & more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think.
As a quick test, ask yourself: """"Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?"""" If the answer is yes, then the image probably does not meet this criterion.
As the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered, there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time.  It is intrinsically true that Berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites.  The only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the """"facts""""  Berry's image then  and let the reader draw their own conclusion.  
What say you?  

No free equivalent. Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose.

You raise a lot of interesting issues. I'll give my thoughts on some of them. First, I think you're right that """"Eric"""" is, at least in some sense, more readable. Second, you're right that we have article titles like Eric I of Norway and Eric VI of Sweden (but also Eirik II of Norway so it's not quite consistent). I think that a high level of Anglicization is expected for the names of royalty where familiar names tend to be used if at all available. If Eiríkr Hákonarson had ever called himself king I would be fine with having his article at """"Eric II of Norway"""". But he wasn't quite royalty and he is a somewhat more obscure historical character than the kings so I'm not quite sure how to apply this. 

As for medieval usage I haven't made a complete study but what I've seen so far is that the Latin charters witnessed by Eiríkr during his life have """"Yric dux"""" (most commonly) or """"Yrric dux"""" or """"Iric dux"""". The Encomium Emmae, written in Latin in 1041 or 1042, has the form """"Eric"""" and titles him as """"dux et princeps provintiae quae Nordwega dicitur"""".

The Anglo-Saxon chronicle (written in Old English, of course) has """"Irke"""" (a dative form) or """"Yric"""" or """"Yrice"""" (a dative form) or """"Eiric"""". (Maybe I missed a variant.)

Old Norse texts are usually published in normalized orthography where the name is """"Eiríkr"""". In diplomatic editions you will probably find forms like """"Eirikr"""" or """"Eiricr"""" or """"Eirijkr"""" but I don't have any at hand at the moment so don't take it as gospel.

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

I believe you were the only one other than the proposer who agreed to move the article name. Your only reply was that you weren't going to change your mind. I can't understand why you didn't understand the reasoning for not changing. Is it because you are stubborn perhaps? I noticed before you saying similar things at different articles. Perhaps it is because you are too stubborn. I would rather that than think you just dislike every language other than English. Secondly, and this one is close to my heart, I'm starting to think you continually, and without being encouraged in any way, enjoy telling Scots, Welsh and English people that you only look on them as British whether or not they self identify as Scots/Welsh or English. You even brought your last discussion on it from Elonkas talk page just to get it up and running. Even going so far as to question whether Scotland should have their own football league participating in Europe. You then go on to say that you know nothing of football which makes me wonder why you would comment on something you know nothing about. All this makes me wonder why?

Oops, I think I'm seeing the issue and it is indeed my error.  Somehow I missed that the epidemiology section had a second section regarding comorbidity in it.  I have struck my comment above, and in the future I won't mention it again unless it's relevant to acknolwedge my previous error.  My apologies.
I would argue however that """"incidence"""", which relates to new appearances of DID in the community at large, isn't a good subheading because the section includes a discussion of both incidence and prevalence.  I suggest using a subheading with both (==Incidence and prevalence==) though another option is simply leaving it as epidemiology.  The WP:MEDMOS#Diseases or disorders or syndromes doesn't give much guiance here bar noting that ==Epidemiology== should include incidence and prevalence information; no mention of subsections.  Usually you leave it as a single larger section until it gets sufficiently lengthy that it makes sense to split them out (which is itself dependent on the sources).  I've replaced the section heading (but both I and P).  The section overall needs fleshing out with more sources, which I think are unfortunately lacking.  Searching on pubmed for DID and both incidence and prevalence turns up no articles specifically focussed on either topic.   (t) (c) Wikipedia's rules:simple/complex

 Just a question 

Hi!

I don't want to impose too much, but I'm curious: Did you actually read the article that started the altercation between me and Medeis, or did you just look at the links he provided to his own talk page? I fully admit that I was being mildly insulting. I can also assure you that I could have done much """"better"""" at being insulting if I had put the effort into it. Medeis himself has also proven himself capable of insults as you can see by browsing his talk page and then looking up the other side. One particularly inelegant response to somebody who did not agree with him was """"Hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Eh hm. Huh, hah, ha, ha, ha! (Hah!)"""". But he seems to have developed a habit of threatening all kinds of things, if his own hide is pierced.

He's new, I'll grant that. But if you want to know what the fuss was about, it started right here: Pama–Nyungan languages. He seems to be reverter-in-charge of that page. By his own admission he knows nothing about the subject. Neither do I, as a matter of fact, but there are a couple of things that I am aware of in this field, and one of them is that the current orthodoxy is still in its hypothesis stage.

Take a look if you're interested in Australian languages, but beware of the article's bias - this bias is what started it all.

As for me and Medeis I suspect you'd rather prefer never to have known about us at all.

According to your logic, reverting vandalism would be disruptive too, and should lead to blocking.  I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.  Ordinary users tend to have an editor's attitude, i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible, and not accept other people's bad edits.

Your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy.  Oh, I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length (look at this for example), but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument.  At the end of the day, the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content.  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia.

In the specific case of me versus Eiorgio, your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that I only discussed in the edit summaries.  In reality, I tried to reason with him on his talk page, but he simply deleted all my comments, showing he had no interest in debating it.

Your mention of sockpuppetry is fantasy and a straw man.  Please do not introduce irrelevant, insulting concepts into the discussion.  With as much validity, I could warn you to make sure that Tawker is not your (good-cop/bad-cop) sockpuppet.

 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.)

Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections, launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

 """"Ants evolved..."""" as a statement of fact. 

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article:
""""Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.""""
Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.   
Very true.   ~talk

heh, viable question.  This spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and I did some rewriting.  It should be double-checked for good measure.  The article answers these well enough.  Ant's live varied amounts of time depending on many things.  Some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years.   ~talk 

 Common ants varieties 

There is almost no mention of Little Black Ants or Red Ants in this article. I see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them.
I'm not sure where you are but if it's Europe then those guys are probably Lasius niger and Myrmica rubra. They aren't common everywhere. '''[[User:Sean.hoyland|",0

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

 Bank of America Anonymous 

Anonymous

On March 14, 2011, one or more members of the decentralized collective Anonymous began releasing emails it said were obtained from Bank of America. According to the group (along with recent federal investigations by State Attorneys General, the New York Department of Finance, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)  the emails document """"corruption and fraud"""" relating to the issue of """"large scale and repeated"""" force placed insurance abuse accelerating home foreclosures and automobile repossessions nationwide.  The source, identified publicly as Brian Penny, is a former LPI Specialist from Balboa Insurance, a firm which used to be owned by the bank, but was sold to Australian Reinsurance Company QBE, who subsequently branded the company QBE First in 2011  in order for the bank to obtain the funds necessary to pay back their Federal loans.

PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that """"a designer created flagella"""", science says """"no further information known"""". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient """"to know"""" that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like """"legitimate possibility"""" or """"probable explanation"""".

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

"vCard & wikiengine 
I where reading Tom Limoncelli Time Management for System Administrators where he mentioned about using wikiengine as a registry for contact information. Then I started to wonder in my small round head about contact format.

vCard sounds quite natural way to save this kind of information. Which leads simply to question how hard it could be to make some notation for contact information when there is way to say this is name, this field is phone number of that previously mentioned name being and so on. If there is notation how to express something then it is quite simple to output vCard, hCard or html table etc. Contact information should be reusable from many different wiki page. I mean that if there's article about HP computer and other about HP printers contact to HP should be single HP contact object.

Unfortunately I don't have glue how code extensions to wiki. I also don't know how much there is contact information in wikipedia, most likely only some. If there would be notation for addresses, phone number etc would anyone use it. Impossible to say. There is also other side of coin. It might be that implementation of contact information notation is just what everybody needed but did not realize needing it. There is also possibility that this idea was completely stupid (actually my ideas usually are not so bright than I self think they are).

If the IMF no longer uses the """"in transition"""" group, it must mean that they feel it no longer reflects a significant economic difference.  To see if this is true, I have plotted the 2007 PPP-based per capita GDP of various countries.  The data comes from the April 2008 IMF World Economic Update.  The countries classified by the IMF as advanced economies are in dark blue, the countries designated by the CIA World Factbook as """"in transition"""" are in light blue (except for Slovenia, which is now classified as advanced), the countries designated as """"least developed"""" by the UN are in red, and the remaining countries are in orange.

Since the """"in transition"""" classification is no no longer used by the IMF and appears not to be useful, I suggest that it should be dropped from the map.

"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   
 I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is """"the scientific study of human populations"""". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   

Non-families

I notice that a lot of Wikipedia articles use some sort of template putting households into four categories: """"had children under the age of 18 living with them"""", """"were married couples living together"""", """"had a female householder with no husband present"""", and  """"non-families"""". These categories do not add up to 100%;, for examples see Downers Grove, Willowick, Ohio, etc etc. Any ideas about where this came from, and how it can be addressed? It seems like a category generated as part of a marketing strategy. Novickas 

Generational Cohorts

"The facts 

For anyone that has further trouble with troublemakers as I have, consider the following from the wikipedia rules (such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism) in your rebuttal (or just ignore them!):

Making bold edits:
    Wikipedians often make sweeping changes to pages in order to improve them - most of us aim to be bold when updating articles. While having large chunks of text you've written removed or substantially rewritten can be frustrating, simply making edits that noticeably alter the text or content of a pages should not be immediately labeled vandalism.

Talk page vandalism
    Removing the comments of other users from talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long talk page by creating an archive page and moving the text from the main talk page there. The above rules do not apply to a user's own talk page, where this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the user's discretion. Please note, though, that removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon.",0

""":::Oooh, """"You're wrong! You're wrong! You're wrong!"""".  Why am I not impressed by your 'debate skills'. 
First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, """"meat puppet"""".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.
And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (""""We don't need no stinkin' consensus!"""").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.

 Wrong date? 
""""In Europe"""" states Pandora's Box is from 1928, """"Filmography"""" states it's from 1929. Which one is correct?

 The authoritative Louise Brooks Society lists it as 1929.  The movie was still be filmed when Brooks turned 22; there's a picture of cast & crew celebrating it on the London attic set.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.192.5.55   

 Philosophy 
I remember reading in one news article about this individual, it was brief and cryptic, concerning pessimistic aesthetics philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
There seems an unnerving concentration on the film persona (particularly with the one from """"Box"""", which I do not think is the best image to dwell on, given that it is one of dehumanization and objectification for varyous fetishistic obsessive types). I have a strong intuition that there was infact ALLOT more to this person then what is being focused on by what appears to be a majority of her fans. Is there any further detail in any of the Seven Seals concerning her philosophy, ideology, and maybe even politics (and at best, religion)? Given her scholarly nature, I strongly doubt any real resemblance to the character of that film. Seek the Forms  

 Tone? 
Hi all, glad to read this article, & I think Louise Brooks is way cool, but I have a quibble:  Here & there, it tends to read like a fansite (i.e., a bit gushy) instead of an encyclopedia article.  Does anyone else have this impression?  I think a few word changes might help.  I can take a shot at it.  

 Oh yeh I have. That and the fact that there is a marked lack of any of her philosophies. I see her, first and foremost, a scholar, who wrote film reviews and seven esseys (their subject is not given in this artical), or even any philisophical works (though, they may have been very, very diluted, given that Shopenhauer was a major influence on her, he held a nihilistic perversion of Neo-Platonism that would lead to social anarchy, followed by dictatorship by the Nietzscheans). I have bumped into this recently and was somewhat impressed, though, not satisfied with a lack of insight into her potentially more important contributions (if any). The secret here is, I suspect most of these people are just obsessed perverts (fans, like you said). Thanks

"The Bereans 

I did some research and I have to agree with you that it is only this Bereans website that is openly labelling Soriano's group as a cult. Who are these Bereans anyway? They are completely unnotable and I am yet to encounter anyone who actually belongs to this anti-cult group? Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet). I don't think that articles from the Bereans website qualify as reliable third-party published source as per WP:RS. If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time. It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included). As I will never use articles from Soriano's website(s) to criticize, say for example, the Baptist sect, I would also not use articles from a Baptist website to criticize Soriano's sect.

Due to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
This section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.

"﻿Sensual Pleasures of the MindItalic text

There are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer
packaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.

Since it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    

All of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.

Knowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to
unearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction
indicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and
discovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.

Having well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition

Being gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.

Sexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.

Sensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your
partner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an
ongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.

Altered states....
1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion
2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.
3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.
5-Head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place
6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.

All sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe.",0

"""== Art of War ==

Thanks for being so understanding.  I hope you decide to stick around.  Regarding The Art of War (disambiguation), there is already a link to Sun-Tzu's book, which El Norte Press has simply issued in a new edition.  WP:DISAMBIG covers the sorts of things that are appropriate for disambiguation pages; since we wouldn't have a whole article on a single edition of a book, we wouldn't mention it on the disambiguation page.  But please feel free to contribute to Wikipedia in other ways.  And (ironic as it might sound now), ignore all rules:  if you do something wrong, someone else will come along and fix it!  ' TalkContribs 

 Ah, I had missed that you had said Mao's Art of War, not Sun Tzu's.  Still, Mao never wrote a book called The Art of War.  The El Norte Press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises.  They would be notable individually, but none would be linked to the Art of War disambiguation page since none of them shares that title, nor could the El Norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises (e.g., On Protracted War). ' TalkContribs 

 There is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of WP:N and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book.  A more specific notability guideline is available at WP:NB.  Since The Art of War (disambiguation) is not a heavily-edited page, leaving this to another editor to correct does not seem likely to resolve this problem.  If you like, you can request a third opinion, which would bring others into the discussion.  ' TalkContribs 

 Thanks for your note.  While anything written by Mao Zedong would count as notable, a collection of his writings, assembled under a title that he never chose, would not be.  It is for this reason that I am loathe to include The Art of War as one of Mao's writings or to put it on the disambiguation page.  One thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers.  That would be a sign of notability.  Did Mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title, The Art of War? Who has discussed the works by this title? ' TalkContribs 

 Thank you again for your comments.  The fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable; blogs are not reliable sources, either.  You mention that this book is used at West Point.  I would correct you to say that this edition has been ordered by the West Point bookstore; the book in question does not exist — except as a creation of El Norte Press.  You mention your expertise:  expert editors addresses this issue, so we don't have to throw our credentials on the table.  If you wish to pursue this further, the link for a third opinion is above.

 Art of War by Mao Zedong Dispute 

Summary of Third Opinion:

Any works attributed by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), not already indexed specifically should be considered notable and deserving of a reference line, as long as they are verified. The editor asking for the inclusion has made an argument for notability. The Art of War community should decide on any future postings regarding this book.

I have re-installed the reference to The Art of War by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) on The Art of War disambiguation page.

If you look at the history of the article, you can see that you repeatedly undid others' edits despite there being no conesnsus for your edit. That is edit warring. When there is no consensus for your version, the correct procedure is to restore the article to the status quo, discuss the issue, and change the article again only if you gain consensus for your edits. Furthermore, comments such as the above are unconstructive and are not conducive to a positive atmosphere.   

Firstly, I would really like to thank you for your kind response here! ) As for me calling Rlevse """"racist"""", that's what it looks like from the way he seems obsessed with keeping out any Lebanese claims. About edit warring: The edit warring article says this """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a discussion, or coerce a given stance on a page without regard to collaborative approaches"""" and also, """"Typically a user who edit wars is ignoring editorial norms, reverting rather than taking due consideration of the points made by others."""" But it also says: """"It states that a user who makes more than three revert actions (of any kind) on any one page within a 24 hour period, may be considered to be edit warring, and blocked appropriately, usually for a 24 hour period for a first incident"""".
Now there was no edit war going on, on the article in question.

As you can see, my first edit was at  00:27, 31 August 2009 which was when I added the note. The edit right after that, was me, improving the note I had added. Right after this second edit, Rlevse reverts my edits. After he does so, I revert his revert and ask that he keep it the way it is while the topic is in discussion. That was it. There was no edit war. 4 Reverts = an Edit war. That was only 1! And even if you wish to count all the edits, that was only 3 and not 4!

One can insert, in context, a cost at one point.  For instance, """"The 'one-time-buy' of M16A1 rifles by the US Army was for a unit cost of $100."""" Even then, contracts are not exact either.

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again! addict  addict """,0

Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues

You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's.

Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?!

Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.

The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist.

Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers.

What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.

It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.

And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.

It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, outside the chapel, I had my reason. Three people were threatened and harassed by the 'Monroe 6 Version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. They were not shy to even include the AIDS infected blood by one of the members. One of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this Wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from Canada, a woman which I have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes.

I am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, NOT to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. I never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did.

Success, so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. Jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another.

It is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that 'Mark Bellinghaus mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known Lori Drew manner. But it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group",0

 only after excommunication 

The article currently states that people are rebaptized only after entering the Church again after excommunication. This is not always true. In addition to rebaptism after removal of one's name from church records* , a bishop may approve a rebaptism for a token of repentance rather than merely membership in the Church. A reference: [W]e had a wonderful older brother in my branch with a gambling addiction.   When he was finally able to overcome it, and despite no official Church punishment, he petitioned for and was granted rebaptism, to witness again to his God, his Church, his family, and (maybe most importantly) himself that he was born again.   Technically, all this good brother needed was the Sacrament of the Lord's Last Supper, but can't you imagine how much more staying power the Sacrament of Baptism and Rebirth has had on his determination? ()

* This administrative action was instituted, IIRC, in the late 70s or mid 80's. It is distinct from excommunication. Prior to this being available, however, a person had to be """"voluntarily excommunicated"""" in order to remove that person's name from Church records, but this is no longer the case.""",0

In fact, as the text of the article states, the population was approximately 1/3 Jewish.
 It uses the term """"settlements"""", thus ignoring Jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like Jerusalem, Safed, and Tiberias.

Nothing personal Radh, I appreciate the input. My rant is directed at Toa mostly. I realize, Tao, you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the """"writers"""" section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower  both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit.
Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, """"beat generation"""" means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an """"excellent and practical solution"""" because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation.  It's just right there.  One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever.

Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before… in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called """"Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared…""""  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate… So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own…. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions """"National Press Club"""" as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as """"National Press Club.""""  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it """"the National Press Club.""""  Again… appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time… whoever, whatever party… etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   """,0

                          The Colour out of Space      

I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow,hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me thatit was Egypt. - HP Lovecraft

This is only a test

At 5:05 on November 22, 1977, regular television programming in southern England was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of """"Grahama,"""" representative of the """"Ashtar Galactic Command,"""" bearing the usual """"space brother"""" boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a New Age. It was quickly dismissed as a hoax, but an extremely complicated one to execute. 

Though the The Sunday Times the following December 4 surmised it was accomplished by students using just """"£80 worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery,"""" no one ever claimed responsibility, and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneously,and it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption, """"suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.""""

This was actually the second message from Grahama. A month earlier, he had said pointedly that """"We conveyed to Sir John Whitmore and to Dr. Puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet Earth. It is now in motion. We wish you to know that we love you.""""

That """"Grahama"""" would single out the aristocratic former racing champion Whitmore and parapsychologist and MKULTRA researcher Andrija Puharich suggests this was no simple hoax: both men were deeply involved with a decades'-long channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the """"70 Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood."""" The entities governing our reality identified themselves The Nine.

Another link to Whitmore and Puharich was British author Stuart Holyroyd's recently published Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth, which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the Nine. In the book, Holroyd wrote that the Nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period 18th to 22nd November.”

Regarding the television interruptions, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write in The Stargate Conspiracy that, """"as usual, there were only two options considered: either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern English through their television sets; or it was hoax, just done for a laugh.The idea that such a message could be easily contrived by, for example, an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has never,to our knowledge, even been considered.""""

Of course there are several pages about me in that same book and I worked with Puharich for a short while.

This seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to Whitmore and Puharich,and especially the latter's service in Army Intelligence and later as a CIA contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.(Whitmore, incidentally, is now also Britain's """"number one business coach,"""" training top executives from companies such as Barclays, Lloyds, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Rolls Royce.) Uri Geller,for a time one of the Nine's channellers, told Picknett and Prince that """"the CIA brought Puharich in to come and get me out of Israel,"""" and in his essay In the Thick of It, physicist Jack Sarfatti writes that """"Puharich was Geller's case officer in America with money provided by Sir John Whitmore.""""

Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland.

What's the explanation?  The Cabal is, obviously, trying to manipulate the encyclopedia article 'jim bell', to keep its errors and omissions from being fixed.  But that's not enough.  They want to (need to!) conceal evidence of their nefarious activites, and that includes instantly (if possible) removing critical references to their misconduct, even on the talk:jim bell page.  (And all references to their misconduct will be critical:  The Cabal ignores all objections to its manipulations, other than to delete, reverse, erase, or otherwise conceal them.)   It remains no violation of WP rules to post from an IP address, particularly if the Cabal is preventing people from correcting an articles errors by any other means.  The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  """,0

It says....

A hypothesis of distant genetic relationship
taking its name from the Altai mountains of central
Asia; it holds that Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic
(Manchu-Tungusic), together comprising some forty
languages, are genetically related. More extended
versions of the Altaic hypothesis would include Korean
and Japanese, sometimes also Ainu. Various scholars in
the early and mid 1800s proposed classifications that
would group some or all of the ‘Altaic’ languages
together, but typically these were included in larger, more
poorly defined proposed affiliations, such as the now
abandoned Ural-Altaic hypothesis.(p.7)

Now abandoned is Ural-Altaic relation which was replaced with , not Altaic.

Eurasiatic Greenberg’s (2000, 2002) hypothesis of a
distant genetic relationship that would group Indo-
European, Uralic–Yukaghir, Altaic, Korean–Japanese–
Ainu, Nivkh, Chukotian and Eskimo–Aleut as members
of a very large ‘linguistic stock’. While there is considerable
overlap in the putative members of Eurasiatic and
Nostratic there are also significant differences. Eurasiatic
has been sharply criticized and is largely rejected by
specialists (Georg and Vovin 2003, 2005). (p. 58)

This statement is somewhat false and a rather elaborate claim. In total, there was 852 French and Indian troops against 1,500 British and Colonials. After the battle ended, the French had suffered a mere 39 casualties, bringing their total strength down to 813. The British however, suffered more casualties than the French had men; they lost 878.

I think I can help with some explanation here, as metamaterials are not fringe or pseudo science but hard science on the cutting edge of our understanding of chemistry, quantum physics, and engineering. The doppler effect is difficult to understand in terms of metamaterials as it requires one to think in ways which we are not used to. The viewer is stationary, yes, but the photons of light or phonons of sound are moving, and moving though a medium with unique refractive properties.  This means that the wave itself will be curved in bizare ways. One of the effects of this is that the apparent wavelength of the photon or phonon will appear to lower as it approaches, and rise as it recedes from, a viewer.  The infinite inertia refers to the fact that a metamaterial can, in precise circumstances, temporarily halt light by trapping it in the lattice of electromagentic fields within the material or within the particles themselves as a quantum spin state charge. Another way to phrase this would be infintite internal inertia. Such effects have been thoroughly demonstrated, and you can see the article slow light for more information. You are correct in saying that very little in science is infinite, but the catch in a metamaterial is that it is not 'infinite' infinite inertia. The infinite inertia is an induced effect that lasts only as long as the proper conditions remain, whether that be an external current applied to the metamaterial, a temperature to which the material is raised or lowered, or internal quantum state which can be thrown off balance. At the point that these conditions end, the light trapped within the metamaterial is freed from its electromagnetic 'cage' and re-emmited. I hope that I have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the properties of these materials. rant """,0

I dare you to continue denying the facts. Go ahead...   

I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...

     
 
- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",0

"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk )",0

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you. Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.

Rankings
At the beginning of October, substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the University's recent performance and advertising. With a few tweaks, this material has mostly been accepted on Wikipedia. However, the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. I reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussion:
In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand. Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts & Humanities, 110th in Engineering & IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences. In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give """"...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/qs-stars/ QS Stars.""""
The second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence, ie from """"In 2011"""" onwards. No reason has been given for this. I have suggested that this third sentence remain, since it is purely factual and referenced, but I am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. My proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. I welcome their explanations here, and input from other parties.-gadfium """,0

Thanks anonymous, but those aren't articles per say.  DCs treat between 85-95% neuromusculoskeletal conditions, and the article will reflect this otherwise it's an undue weight issue.  Regarding your statement that DCs claim to treat various conditions, do you have any evidence of this or is this hearsay?  Hawk et al. provides a comprehensive review of all non NMS conditions which will suffice.  

Also, perhaps you are confused regarding HOW and WHY DCs treat non-NMS conditions.  From the OCA: Chiropractic care may also be used to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic conditions. According to patient surveys, by treating the neuromusculoskeletal elements of such disorders, chiropractic treatment has been shown to improve the general well-being of the patient.  This falls in line with the philosophy of chiropractic in treating in a holistic manner, which this is an example of.   01:04",0

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned.

"I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes.

Yes and no. Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC.
That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said """"give this to rollbackers too"""". I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. And I'm not going to do that.   13:59""",0

 Point of view terms used in the Scott article 

In the modern reaction it is said: 

""""Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

This is rather obvious Point-of-view-terminology. Saying something has survived only until a certain point in time basically means it's dead. Captain Scott's reputation is far from dead, so this is not a true representation of reality.

A correct encyclopedic term would be:

""""Scott's high reputation remained uncontested until the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

Another problem is that it is spoken of a timeframe beyond World War II, but the first book that is mentioned offering criticism in the next sentence is from 1966. Here we have a difference of more than 20 years that are claimed to belong to the time that Scott's high reputation had been contested, while in reality they belong to the uncontested period.

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Gbawden.  I posted this response to Tokyogirl79 and have also posted here for you.  I would also like to request your assistance in gathering and presenting the materials for Wikipedia entries as outlined below.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. (or really just add my voice to the growing dissent that is out there already).  Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

 Ace Combat 3 moving 

Hi JamesofUR. Regarding your recent denial of the move request, you might want to be careful with letting that guy do as he wants around here.

""" anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it. 
Dictionary it, or delete it?  
Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less.  Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction.  The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}.  Both articles discuss the city of Limerick.  We don't have duplicate articles about the same thing here.  However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as """"Stab City"""" for the reasons stated needs to be checked.  The article, like so many such articles, doesn't cite any sources.  With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say """"That's a load of old baloney!  Limerick isn't known as Stab City at all."""" and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for.  Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite.  Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger.  
The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as 'Stab City' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling '""""Stab City"""" -Limerick' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig.  
It wasn't a stub needing work.  It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple.  Both articles are about the city.  I've pointed this out several times, now.  I've also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one.  
You haven't explained why it is 'clearly' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. """"Stab City"""" is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The """"Stab City"""" article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don't have the time or interest to do this.  Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: """"City of Light usually refers to Paris."""" would you put a merge note on Paris too?  
If it were as superficially bogus as """"stab city"""" was: Yes, of course.  This process is known as """"asking for the opinions of other editors"""".  It is a useful tool in some circumstances.  Notice that it works.  Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion.   
It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice.  
I've restored it.  The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote """"as superficially bogus as 'stab city' was"""".  
Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute?  
Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice.  
 The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed.  I think this was in the mid 1980s.  I haven't edited the Stab City article as I'm undecided as to whether it's worth having.  
Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article.
 I agree, merge it now. I can't see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article. I think there's a case for a Crime in Limerick article, but not for one on this piece",0

 Removal of images of nudes 

To editor 96.60.28.170... To be honest, you raise a good point; however, it is my opinion that any children who may see these images of classic paintings will not only be enriched by them, but also they will probably not see the """"nasty"""" side that some adults might see.  When I was a child, I saw great beauty is such works of art.  And I also saw great beauty in a Van Gogh, or a Rembrandt or any number of works by great artists.  Sculptures of David, Venus de Milo and other nude or scantily clad subjects are a part of this world.  And I might add they are some of the better parts of this world. 

Since this is an article about """"Truth"""", I would ask you to honestly state your real concerns here.  Are you worried that some child will see these nudes and they will cause him to become a pervert?  Is it your concern that children will be permanently marred by being exposed to nudity?  Children, as you may know, have very short attention spans.  They revel in one fascinating thing after another, rarely staying with one thing for any length of time.  In any case, it is a violation of Wikipedia's Neutral point of view policy, as well as the content preservation policy to remove works of art such as these for no reason other than it is one person's point of view that the nudes should not be viewed by children.  If these images are offensive to you, then by all means use your mouth quickly and click on another article.  There are several other articles related to Truth that can be found in the Navbars near the bottom of the article.  Best of everything to you and yours!

"I just tagged the ones you marked.  However, before we take this to a more public review, I would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay.  No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.

 As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.

 In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.  Hence, you'll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.",0

What is a ballast house? How many times do I have to tell you? Solid evidence please.   
 a ballast house is where they keep the stones placed under tracks. they are now used for track marshalls when they are working on the track - hence they now have windows. there are plenty of them around and like i said there is one where denvilles station was.  
 on the picture you can see a clearing where the station building and platform foundations still exist. some of them blue bricks are still around. the blue bricks were common on the also disused section of the metropolitan line near amersham so it could have been designed by the same architech  
What picture? I am getting a bit fed up of being told what you can see on the ground. Just find me three articles on the web that mention this station. (You name me any other closed English railway station and I will give you half a dozen links to it.)   

This station does not exist according to a Railatlas (OPC 10th edition) and Quail (latest Southern Region edition). Quail lists ALL old stations. I ride the line frequently and there is nothing of interest in the marked area.  

 Possible signal boxes 

Are there any level crossings in Denvilles needing a signal box to interlock it.  All things considered, under the Block Telegraph system of safeworking, such a box would allow a train to advance closer to the junction at Havant from the previous station at Rowlands Castle railway station, which is quite a long way away.

 

Additional information
Denvilles railway station existed between 1858 and 1859 only, though there are remains there to this day.  That might explain the paucity of sources on the internet, though I've found one and added it..

 Statement by {Party 1} 
Nothing being presented here is being taken seriously and all I'm receiving are responses that suggest Nightshift36 has already made up his mind that no matter what is presented, nothing will be added, no matter what the source. http://www.theblackdragonfightingsociety.com/frank_dux.html this website lists many sources that verify his claims and they are still being denied. For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was,",0

Vandal activity down since you left
Rick, it's interesting to note that since you left, vandalism on Wikipedia has gone down. It's clear that you and those like you simply act to frustrate and abuse legitimate users, whose angry responses can be classed as vandalism, giving you an increased sense of self importance. We don't need that, we need more quality editors, not more volunteer vigilantes.  
That's the biggest absurd I've ever heard. 
Indeed; it is my impression there is considerably more vandalism now. The edits of the sockuppet above would be one small example. (talk) 
Indeed.  I've blocked more in the last day than in the previous 18 months as an admin, which can only be due to the """"RickK and Heph gap"""". Complaining about RickK and Heph is like having an allergy and wishing you didn't have an immune system.   |  Talk 18:40, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?  Pete 
If memory serves, Angela did a survey a while back (Feb or March of 2004) where she sampled the number of blocks each admin had given. Rickk had almost as many as the next 3 people combined.  19:19, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
Personally? I frequently saw his edits, and he left a useful note on my talk page correcting me for something.  

Isn't it obvious to everyone?  RickK created a whole entourage of sockpuppets, then vandalised with them, then blocked them.  Just to fulfill his self-aggrandising dreams.  He made fools of us all, just to prove that he was brilliant.  Don't you hate him?  Kill RickK, kill RickK, kill RickK'''!  

I can safely say that ever since RickK's departure, I have been faced with reverting five times the vandalism I did prior, which still dosen't come close to his legendary vandal fighting, troll combatting, and trash disposing.  
Nonsense! I wish him and his many sockpuppets stay out!  

To Raul654, now that I can believe ). Statistics on the effect of handing out bans liberally would be great to have.  Pete 

My experience in the Wikiworld has shown RickK to be abusive of other users, authoritarian, consistently reverting other peoples edits without apparent reason and unwilling to join a debate on a given subject when his arguments were confronted. Personally, Im glad he gave up.

"Pesher theory, Satanic Attack or Religion Novice
One could interpret Dr Thiering's pesher theory as a Satanic attack
to discredit deity in religion... at best. Or one could simply chalk
it down to a novice babbling away.

From St Augustine through 1,000s of saints and experts, deeper understanding
reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

The final proof then will be in the Second Coming which pesher theory would
equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when

 Dear Mr.Slrubenstein. Your point about NOR and verifiable sources is well taken. Accordingly I am providing an official Government of India biography of Ram Mohan Roy from the Press & Information Ministry of India which claims that Roy studied Judaism (in addition to other religions). The URL is http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fmay2002/f020520021.html . I do not know if you will recognise this because this same government for many years did not recognise the State (country) of Israel. Of course this only states that Roy """"studied"""" Judaism and is not conclusive proof that Brahmoism was influenced by Judaism. However, we find significant similarities between the Brahmo Dharma beej of 1850 and some tenets of Judaism such as Maimonides. You will appreciate that these issues are unproveable and matters of faith and I do not doubt yours. Likewise, I leave it up to you to do the right thing. Brahmos are highly unlikely to claim that they are Jews (of any kind) or distort / vandalise your religion/faith. My Brahmo religion specifically prohibits reviling or disparaging other faiths whilst emphasising strengthening the bonds between *men* of different faiths. I personally have not known many Jews (Judaists) as there are so few in India, I was lucky to have a learned tutor - his name was Ezra - he had a PhD and attended synagogue and I learnt many things from him besides Mathematics. I respect your wishes to scrutinise all the other faiths which claim to have been influenced by Judaism. Sincerely.   """,0

The documentary year book with which I found that """"Diaoyu Islands"""" but no """"Senkaku Islands"""" was used by SG of the UN in his official letter is an international almanac, named """"International Organizations and the Law of the Sea: Documentary Yearbook 1996"""" of """"NILOS Documentary Yearbook"""". It is for collection of related documents from the United Nations system. Therefore, this is a very high, if not the highest, quality of year book or almanac. Another UN document a UN General Assembly document can be found in page 85 of this year book, which mentioned """"D"""" and """"S"""" as follows:""""Since the 1970s, China and Japan have continued to dispute sovereignty over a group of five islets and barren rocks, known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, ..."""". And for encyclopedias, I checked Britannica, neither """"Senkaku Islands"""" nor """"Diaoyu Islands"""" can be found . When you asserted """"all"""" Encyclopedias, """"all"""" almanacs, can you list all of them you checked? Please don't do cherry-picking. Don't assert too much more than what you actually did. Bobthefish2 ever gave a search result on Library of Congress, I re-checked it and am sure it is correct:

(note: Bobthefish2 has been topic banned for a year due to """"Decorum"""" issue, but it does not mean that the objective contents he used before cannot be used by us)
So, your point1 can be used by us to reach certain consensus. Your point2 is biased and it asserted too much more than reality and objectivity.

 Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind 

Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. 

My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.   """,0

 Background 

The background people keep reverting to, in spite of all discussion, is still absolute Israeli bias.
 
Firstly the version you keep reverting to does not mention the fundamental background to the Israeli-Lebanese conflicts, the existence of Palestinian refugees. Secondly the """"failed to control"""" phrase in the first sentence has connotations far too negative towards Lebanon, and ignores the fact that Lebanon has suffered far more greatly than Israel from militancy within its borders. Thirdly the background mentions that Hizbollah continued to make attacks on Israel after Israeli withdrawal from most of Lebanon (attacks whose frequency have incidentally been greatly exaggerated), yet it doesn't mention that Israel also carried out incursions into Lebanon during this period. Once again I re-iterate, it is those who keep reverting who are not respecting the neutrality of this article, and no-one has has yet explained to me how I in any way am breaching WP:NPOV in this article

 Context  
To fully understand the nature of Limbaugh's comments, full context of the entire conversation must be included in the article. On the September 26, 2007, radio broadcast of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh received telephone calls from two listeners regarding the Iraq War. The first caller, """"Mike in Chicago"""", who identified himself as a Republican and former service member, told Limbaugh, """"I do believe that we should pull out of Iraq."""" Limbaugh argued with the caller and ended up treating him dismissively.  After that call, Limbaugh next spoke to a listener who wanted to """"retort to Mike in Chicago"""" (the original caller).  This second caller, who identified himself as a soldier,  complained that the media never talked to """"real soldiers"""" like himself.  He was clearly responding directly to the first caller, who had told Limbaugh he felt the Iraq War was a mistake.  The current version of the article only contains the conversation with the second caller.  It doesn't make it clear that the second caller's remarks are in response to """"Mike in Chicago""""'s anti-war comments.  This second caller never mentioned Jesse Macbeth at all.  With the addition of the first conversation, the New York Times response that Limbaugh's """"phony soldiers"""" comment was """"referring to Iraq war veterans critical of the war"""" makes sense.

"== Some Main Mechanisms for Transitional Justice in Burma ==

By Aung Thiha

What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances. 

In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. 

Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.  

Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. 

Fourth, reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. For instance, in Germany the government compens",0

MTBF has a lot of meaning, but it does not mean the device will last 136 years. All of these misunderstandings are really surprising. And it does not mean that you will not see a failure in home use. Saying you will never see a failure is just dumb.  What does it really mean? It means that one out of every 136 devices will have a mechanical failure every year. Or, equivalently, if there were 1360 devices spinning, then on average, 10 would mechanically fail every year. That is the meaning of 1.2 million hours. But, this needs to be put into context. Infant mortality is not counted, because those devices never were in use. Software failures, user failures, infrastructure failures (brownouts), heat and overheating, and viral or deliberate attacks are not counted either. So, a home user is still going to see the failure every few years. Even with enterprise drives. What the home user should not see is driving the drive to death. It should be built for continuous action of the head, and that action not fail for, on average, 1.2 million hours.   21:43, 9 February 2014",0

Speech is the saying of the words (i.e. a transmitter), but in no way implies that the listener (reciever) has actually gotten anything out of it. That is how UDP protocol is structured.

Talk is also used when talking to other people, in Standard English you would say """"i am talking to someone"""" However this varies when we look at Australian, South African or Estuary English. This is due to changes in dialect. In Standard Australian English, one would say 'I'm talkin' to someone darl'"""" and in South African one would say, """"I'm talking to someone, yis?"""" and in Estuary English one would say, """"Can't yoow see im talkin' to someone love?

 Involvement in heroin production

 Parker v DC 

I just looked at my comments, and """"Wikipedia policy be damned"""" doesn't appear there. The policy you cited as an excuse for loading up irrelevant commentary doesn't compel leaving such rubbish in the entry.

What you're doing is finding materials that regurgitate either the Court's dissent or arguments in dissent and posting them under """"Controversy"""".

I appreciate not everyone is pleased with the Court's decision.

The place for their arguments is either before the entire Circuit Court if it grants a hearing, or before the Supreme Court if it goes there.

For example, Chemerinsky's rejection of the Court's plain English decision doesn't deserve a full paragraph. Chemerinsky has an argument, the Court considered it as proposed by the parties and amici curae, and rejected it. He, and you, should accept that and gear up for the next hearing, if any. Basically he """"argued that the ruling had 'no basis in constitutional law'."""" Your propose long quote adds nothing of substance to that.

Take a look at the article on the Second Amendment for an example of how to handle it.""",0

Suburban Express

We would apprciate any guidance you can give us http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Guidance_Sought  We feel the Suburban Express article is being dominated by haters, who cry foul whenever and however we push back. We would like to see the article more neutral/balanced/objective.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.147.28.113   

Hi. I've made some suggestions at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Guidance Sought.  (talk · contribs · email)  

Hello. As you know, I'm waiting for a pending name change. I've stayed away from posting on the noticeboard until the name change is complete, and I thoroughly appreciate that I have a COI and must not edit Suburban Express. However, I am under the impression that it is permissible for me to contribute to the Suburban Express talk page. One thing that has plagued the article is the fact that conventional-media sources are not necessarily avaialble online. There has been productive discussion on the talk page today, and I am encouraged by that, and I offered up two conventional-media articles, which are pdf's on my company's server  because they do not exist elsewhere on the internet. The links were immediately whacked by OrangeMike:

""""20:46, 27 October 2013‎ Orangemike (talk | contribs)‎ . . (188,881 bytes) (-367)‎ . . (1. You were unblocked so you could get a new username; 2. those were links to your corporate website) (undo)""""

I have two questions: 1) Should I have posted as IP user instead? Or am I just expected to keep quiet until the username change is complete?, 2) What is the issue with the """"corporate website""""? The links are to pdf's of legitimate, unaltered news paper articles.

Your guidance will be appreciated.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Hi. Sorry. You and I are on opposite sides of the world. That was because Orangemike wants you to create a user name that conforms to WP:ROLE before you do any more communicating here, and he (mistakenly in my opinion) thinks it is a copyright violation to briefly host a link to a copyrighted document while a few people discuss it. 
I don't have time to get involved with your case but my one reading of the article tells me that it needs to say something about the litigation - provided the sources reporting it are strong. If they do conform to Wikipedia:Reliable sources, don't expect to have all mention removed. The quality of the sources can be assessed by independent eyes at WP:RSN or maybe you could attract more independent eyes via a Wikipedia:Request for comment (you should follow that blue link if you don't already know about RFC) on the article's talk page. And the amount of space devoted to the litigation and criticism of it (and the language used) needs independent eyes (maybe at WP:NPOVN or at an RFC if you decide to go down that road). 
User:SlimVirgin is a very experienced, widely-respected admin. If she offers any advice, it's usually worth taking.

 Ayers 

He's never been convicted has he? X 
As far as I know, no.  Pretty sure of that.  Why?    
He's never been prosecuted, never been convicted. Calling him a terrorist is OR as well. X 
I mean, it's a BLP issue. There's no proof to it. X 
Where is he called a terrorist?  We just closed an WP:RFC with consensus against doing so, so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up.  There is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate.    
He admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. Ayers is a terrorist.   
You certainly have a right to that opinion.  On Wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one.  Incidentaly, the Weathermen is not """"certified"""" as anything, nor does Ayers agree that he is a terrorist.  There is considerable reason why we don't do that here.  But that's moot.  That's gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final.    
You are wrong. I know it is hard to admit when one is wrong, but you should try. The Weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the FBI - if that isn't a certified then I don't know what is. If someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. I mean, you might as well argue that Paul McCartney isn't a singer unless he is declared as such.  
 You must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that Noroton posted at the RfC calling Ayers a terrorist.   
And you must have missed the point. According to the legal system, Ayers has never committed a violent act. X 
 Put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now.    
Gentlemen, perhaps you can have a debate over whether Ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page - there are a million pages on Wikipedia, three million really, and I don't really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue.  On Wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him.  There are probably a hundred thousand blog pages, message boards, etc., where you can call him a terrorist to your heart's content.    
Wow, you are a flaming liberal, aren't you?  So, let me get this straight...

In your opinion, someone who builds bombs for use against the U.S. Government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist.  Let us all hope you aren't in a position of leadership in real life.  Simply appalling, really. 75.40.204.26  
No! What don't you fucking get? Nobody is saying """"Ayers isn't a terrorist."""" Just that per Wikipedia policies, he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. X 
And the organization, which he helped found, was classified, by the FBI, as a terrorist organization. What more do you want? Shall we repeal the 5th amendment and waterboard, """"I'm a terrorist"""" out of him?  """,0

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet you ignore the fact that:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+)and you contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from a buyer's desired litter to another compatible (again, based on your own determination) litter AFTER the buyer has submitted payment to you. (see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""")

You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time of purchase, but you also require them to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights, in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement or even a suggestion by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), your own literature (except some very limited information by Dr. Padgett and numerous and righteous religious and biblical quotations).

You are the """"Chairman"""" of the board of directors for your registry's dog club, the SSDCA (which charges for membership and participation in club activities).  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override any challenges to your decisions.

You control the ISSR dog registry, which charges puppy owners/breeders numerous fees for numerous types of registration papers and other background information, not to mention also deciding if/when/where/how any breeders in your registry are allowed to breed their dogs.  There is also no arbitration committee available within this organization to negotiate/override",0

The concept of home video could be approached from an ontological perspective as well: """"It is unrelenting footage that rolls on and on.

One quote from now-Congressman McKinley says it all:

""": I found three other sources that use the term. Two provide minor coverage (though one is about a specific language, Malbolge), while one provides significant coverage of the topic:

  Just a brief one-line usage of the term to describe Malbolge: """"Malbolge is known as one of the most esoteric programming languages. In this paper, we prove that Malbolge is weakly Turing complete.""""

  Just a brief one-line usage of the term in the references, citing this article: """"The following URL has some links to the different Esoteric Programming Languages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language""""

  Discusses the topic at length. Largely verbatim excerpts from a 2005 conference paper co-authored by Mateas. Favors the term """"weird language"""" but says """"esoteric"""" is more commonly used.

 I think Mateas and Cox are enough to establish notability of the subject. As far as I can tell, the term as it's used here was invented by editor 163.1.103.122 in this article in 2002, and expanded in scope later that day by editor 213.253.40.113 (the definition has been stable since then). The term may have been taken out of context from an earlier website called """"Esoteric Topics in Computer Programming""""; that site used """"Esoteric Programming Languages"""" as a section name about a much broader set of languages, seeming to use """"esoteric"""" as an adjective like """"unusual"""" rather than as part of a specific term. None of this is from a reliable source, it's original research and not suitable for inclusion in the article, but it may be useful for others trying to find information on the subject.

"How do they pick up the words? 
     You can't use words you don't know.
     Granted, it's very hard nowadays to be sheltered from swearing and cursing, but I'm relieved that in my curiosity I found that the percentage of those with TS who exhibited this is considerably less than half. Because the way the media and others have stigmatized this, it makes it sound like people pick up swear words even if they've never heard them; and that's not possible, language must be learned.
     That brings me to my question, which I think should be part of the topic. How, do those with this pick up the words, and why do they automatically use taboo words? Like, say for instance, I know someone with TS who has never heard ****. He hears it, I act shocked, and so he figures it's taboo. Does the part of his mind that says not to say it then turn off, or what?
     Further, what about someone growing up in an environment where the words are *not* taboo, like some inner cities where every 2nd word is ****? Does this person then *not* say the taboo word becasue where they've grown up, they haven't learned it is taboo?

The topic of mutual intelligibility in Slavic languages is a bit difficult. For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying """"speaking like a Bulgarian"""" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. 
As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So """"a limited intelligibility"""" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)

 Russians in Georgia 

First, here's some statistics (all the Soviet censuses) for Georgia proper, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It's in Russian but you shouldn't have any difficulties with these tables (Russians are """"русские"""" in Russian, just find appropriate columns).

Georgia

Ethnic Russians appeared in Georgia in significant numbers after Georgia became part of the Russian Empire in 1803 (Kartli and Kakheti) - 1878 (Ajara). There were 79082 and 19273 people who indicated Russian as their mother language in Tiflis Governorate  and Kutais Governorate  respectively. Dukhobors have to be mentioned as well.

As you can see from the census data the Russian population had risen from 83 to the maximum of 319 thousand between 1926 and 1959 and then began to decline slowly to 266 thousand in 1989. Migration and lower birth rates were the main reasons of this decline.

Obviously, many Russians left Georgia during the 1990s due to economic hardships (mainly, imho) and other reasons.

 Response to Gnangarra and a suggestion for a compromise 
Introduction:Thanks Gnangarra for your comments. Everyone interprets policies differently and this talk page is no exception to that. There are two policies widely debated here, which are WP:BLP and WP:UNDUE. I am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page, I did not include opinions from BLP notice board and individual members talk pages. If I may have made mistakes (unintentional) in the summarisation, please feel free to remind me and I will correct. Now, while Gnangarra, Pete (Skyring), Suturz and Yeti Hunter think it is WP:BLP violation, MickMacNee, Merbabu, Orderinchaos, Peter Ballard, chaser, Lester, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont. Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WP:UNDUE MickMacNee, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont.

Quote from WP:BLP

My interpretation:The reason why Gnangarra thinks it violates BLP is because of the availability of only one reliable source. As far as I understand, reliable sources in plural do not mean that it needs more than one reliable source. Even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by Gnangarra, we have more than one instance when Howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page, including the head of a state. Please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. Due to these reasons, I personally think that this does not violate BLP (as with many others).

Clarify you are taking my comments out of context, you ask specifically what policies was I quoting for opposing the text. It was the lack of multiple independent sources, ie one reliable source the ABC article, though still questionable as its lacking specific details. In this BLP is clear poorly source contentious material should be removed. garra 

Quote from WP:UNDUE
 and 

My interpretation:
I guess the first quote deals with two different views. An example can be that one view being that the world is round and one being world is flat. In our current dispute, I am not sure what we are comparing. Are we comparing reports that he was alleged of war crimes and not alleged of war crimes (if such reports exists which contradict the ABC news reports) or are we comparing that he was alleged of war crimes and he never commited war crimes. It is hard to make the distinction here.

The second quote says that minority view should not be represented at all except in articles devoted to those views. The content in dispute may fail inclusion as per WP:UNDUE because the belief that he commited war crimes are held by a small n",0

Pharamaceutical companies often sell drugs at massive profit to consumers desperate to recuperate from fatal and chronic illnesses, despite some of these drugs demonstrating less than 50% efficacy in randomised double blind studies. At the same time, the pharmaceuticals fund 'independent' studies that dismiss the efficacy of naturally occurring compounds (where patent claim cannot be made).

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so it has articles about topics, not entries about words or expressions. This article is trying to cover an expression with unclear meaning, not a topic. That's the fundamental problem.
Specifically to your diff: I agree with the removal of these links. The first is not appropriate here because criticism of atheism is relevant to this article only because it is relevant to atheism and atheism is relevant to this article. The second link target is perhaps slightly more relevant, but still not relevant enough to justify such a prominent link from an overall topic to a TV documentary.

"""I am sorry to have hurt your religious beliefs. Seriously, are you asking me to find sources when you have none? Are you aware that """"Wikipedia is not a democracy""""? Refer to WP:POLL. I do not see the consensus. I agree with the oldest surviving monotheistic religion part but I completely disagree with the claim of Judaism being the oldest surviving religion for two reasons:
1) There is no scholarly source making this claim apart from some anonymous (Jewish?) child who has uploaded some pdf file on a website that has zero credibility. Are you serious? I still am shocked to see that you guys are defending an anonymous kid's high school homework paper as a legitimate source of knowledge, to be honorably quoted on the Wikipedia.
2) Credible sources (like Encyclopaedia Britannica ) are saying that another religion is the oldest surviving religion. On the Wikipedia article on Hinduism, the exact same claim is made but with reliable sources (See WP:SOURCES):
Among its direct roots is the  historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India and, as such, Hinduism is often called the """"oldest living religion""""D. S. Sarma, Kenneth W. Morgan, The Religion of the Hindus, 1953 or the """"oldest living major religion"""" in the world.in the world.
 
So, my question is: which page on the Wikipedia is to be trusted in this regard? The one with reliable scholarly sources or the one with anonymous self-published pdf files? I still do not understand why the name of the authors are not given and they are considered scholarly sources. Where were these cited works published? Where are the references in the works? These essays are saying """"God made a pact with Abraham..."""" and so forth. How can this be even taken seriously if the article is assuming that all the God pact story is actual historical fact? Any way, that's the besides the main point. The real issues here are reliable sources, self-published sources, verifiability and original research (by anonymous teenage prodigal scholars).

Now let us examine the scholar """"noel12"""" from Texas who wrote this high school homework paper. On the cited source, the said scholar claims to be 15  at the time of writing this scholarly article. Do we still need to talk about WP:V in this regard? The other cited source (a music website run by Jewish people) does not even have a title or name of the author or date of publication or anything except the bold claim that Judaism is the oldest religion.

Please do not take this personally or anything (I really wish to stress this twice); I just like to see Wikipedia as a reliable encyclopedia. Is it more about reflecting personal sentiments or providing credible knowledge, cited with scholarly sources?

In summary, I say that the uncited claim of Judaism being the oldest surviving religion be removed, while keeping the oldest monotheistic religion part and keep Wikipedia a serious, unbiased encyclopedia. Hope I have appealed to your better judgement.

"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku, Demographics of Azerbaijan, .az History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Ottoman Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans, List of Azerbaijanis, and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

 Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.

Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: “childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonable” and earlier “an insufferable ninny.” The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)

Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: """"Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens."""" ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.

Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:

. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:

You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.

I hope that is satisfactory.

That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua – isn’t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting.

You cannot simply revert changes you dislike, I am afraid; Wikipedia does not work like that. Please take this as a lesson, as I will be forced to block you again if you continue such behaviour - and considering that many other admins apart from myself have blocked you on numerous occasions, eventually you may find yourself indefinitely banned by community decision. I would sincerely hope an intelligent individual such as yourself would modify your behaviour to prevent such a course of action being necessary. Regards,  | (talk)

 Does the rubberband AI section have anything to do with AI? 

The rubberband AI section section describes a situation where a computer controlled character get a bonus when losing. However in most of the examples in this section, the bonus is not related to AI, because the bonus does not make the computer controlled character smarter og it doesn't give the  computer controlled character any new information. As an example the section mentions a game where a computer controlled racing car gets a speed bonus. This bonus is not related to AI and it doesn't not belong to an article about """"Game artificial intelligence"""". I suggest that the section about """"rubberband AI"""" is moved to a separate article called """"rubberband bonus"""".  """,0

You want peopel to beelive her ideas and are willignto do anyhtign to make her seem as imprsive as possibl an rmeove all oposiiton to her vies.

My Chrisytaintiy is sued asa blundgeoon. You make it osund as if I oppose Acharya base don my faiht, hate her, and vehemntly opose her, and htus want ot attakc her. You then claim the aritlce is written in sch a way that it attakcs her. No spacific exampels of attakc are shown gowever.

I can assure you, nothign ithe article that is the current ocncensus among the general posters ( As oppsoed ot the Acharyans) is derogatory towards her.

But yo wish to rmeove the links ot CHrisyain rebuttals and all critisms.

If Dorothy wants to attack Chrisgaunity, why has she then no supply of courage to stand up to their rebuttals?

As far as becoming a future admin, I've pondered in the past if I'd be willing to go through that at some point in the future... and I'm really not sure if I'd want to.  It would be an honor if I were an admin, but that's a lot of responsibility and I'm not sure that I'm the right person for that.  And with my new philosophy (I explained it in my past post) I'd have to take more responsibility than, at this point of my editing career, I'm willing to take.  Much later in the future, I might change my opinion.  But I've gotten into several disputes in the past and I'm trying to change my entire philosophy to negate all the problems I've caused in the past.  Having been blocked for the first time ever, ironically during the time that my friend  was blocked, adminship isn't something that I'm going to even consider about considering about considering at this time.

", as I promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that I am very familiar with ... i.e.,  oil refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants (extracting natural gas liquids known as NGL's), and other hydrocarbon processing industries. Those industries probably have perhaps 80% or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence.

Other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation, but I am not familiar with those industries.

Major Industrial Distillation Types: The two primary types of industrial distillations are Continuous Fractionation or (Continuous Distillation) and Batch Distillation. The industrial Continuous Fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large, vertical, cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the Fractional distillation article. Please note  that by continuous, I mean 24 hours a day for 1 to 3 years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance ... and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about 65 centimeters to 6 meters and heights ranging from about 6 meters to 60 meters or more.

There are many subsets of the Continuous Fractionation primary distillation type, such as: 

 Fractional distillation
 Vacuum distillation
 Azeotropic distillation 
 Extractive distillation
 Steam distillation

The above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary Continuous Fractionation towers. The vacuum towers require reinforcement (provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors) so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum. 

As for the vapor-liquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers, it is virtually impossible to explain bubble-cap or valve trays (or sheet steel structural packing) without drawings or photographs.  We need someone who could make such drawings. We also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettle-type reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a  distillation tower (although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces, horizontal or vertical heat exchangers, bayonet heat exchangers, etc.).

Finally, if you look at the the simple sketch that I made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the Fractional distillation article, that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream  entry (at about the center height of the tower), and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler .... with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower. -",0

Elementary algebra may explains to readers certain core complex number ideas quite well, but I only put it out there for discussion.  Argand diagrams made complex numbers respectable.  These diagrams are metaphors, far from exact ones, of the imaginary field, yet appear in the article. Imaginary numbers are not yet points.  Keith Devlin wrote """"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion."""" Yet he also stated """"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number."""" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that """"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors."""" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed. Gao, X, et. al,  Beijing, China 1998, Google eBook: 108] They're the clock hand that points to the hour, not the hour point. 

Consistent with this logic, it's better to consider the plane rotating under the complex vector than the vector itself.  This sidesteps the variability of complex number position: its the plane's fault, if you will.  Want this grounded in mathematical foundations?  Look no further than the Riemann hypothesis.

Riemann extended Euler's zeta function, which Euler developed to find prime numbers, to define complex numbers.  Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.

The only singularity of z(s) is the simple pole at s, or 1. There is no reason to assume complex numbers are points.  I don't believe this is non-standard. It is profound and documented.

Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result.

Discussion of Censorship in this section
If editors wish to rely upon policy to censor - do not choose only the bits that you need to manipulate the discussion to form a directed conclusion.

First: the policy that was mis-quoted here on this page applied to Harrassment:

It required an un-involved administrator to invoke. You are clearly not.

Second: the community explicitly rejected censorship of records in the public domain. There was no consensus found to censor such knowledge from our encyclopedia readers. """"No consensus found"""" = rejected idea.

Third: The correspondence is unequivocally, irrevocably and famously in the public domain and is clearly allowed by the arbcom editing principle referred to above.

In short, the policy quoted does not apply - as one can clearly see from the distinctions made regarding on-wiki harassment and the rejected proposal, and secondly as an involved editor in the subject ... it is not your place.99.141.241.135  """,0

"Email to Sean Black 

I did not want this text to be publicly known, since I still have to contact the professors, but in the current situation I see no choice but to put the draft text here. 

PM 1. I earlier emailed this draft to Rob Speer and Joe Hall for comment, and just sent it out to Sean Black. 
PM 2. I noticed that I am also blocked from the RfC page. I have not had much time to investigate what the intention of that page is, since I am writing my email to the professors, so I don't know whether that page or being blocked from it is important.
PM 3. It is not true that I only editted pages on myself.
PM 4. Who hold that contacting a professor would be the same as contacting an employer, neglect my earlier comment that I approach the issue from the angle of the integrity of science. The proper reaction is not to neglect it but give the argument why this angle would be improper. 
PM 5. On the RfC Joe Hall suggests that my objective would be to punish him or so. No, I only suggest that the professor and he discuss the situation from the angle of the integrity of science. Earlier I wrote that this would be very beneficial for him. 
PM 6. Joe mentioned that Hal Varian no longer is the dean at SIMS. Thus the draft needs at least one change.
PM 7. I told everyone that I wanted a time out. Why don't you respect that wish ? Didn't I read somewhere that a truce was also an option ? 

Dear Mr. Black,

I saw that, while I was composing my letter to the professors at MIT and SIMS, further action on wikipedia about me. There is an RfC which I am not familiar with and now you seem to have been blocking me whatever that is. 

Below you find the draft text of my letter to the professors. If you think that this is threatening and not befitting a scientific community, please reply.

A few hours ago I already sent this draft text to Rob Speer and Joe Hall. With an introductory text, that I no longer have, since wiki-mail has no cc. But they might forward the email sent to them.

I would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what I can expect.

Dear professors Hockfield and Varian,
Dear Hal,

I have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an unhelpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix.

Obviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.

In the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.

It is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose. 
In the end, it is with",0

This is why we present this anonymously to you. Our intentions are pure and honest and we do not mean to stir up drama. We are gravely concerned regarding the hiring of Oliver Keyes to a position within the Wikimedia Foundation. He has long been known as a very difficult person to work with and he regularly engages in unsolicited attacks. We strongly feel that his hiring by the WMF is a dark stain on the part of the WMF and we strongly urge the WMF to seriously reconsider his appointment. Sincerely, Concerned Editors 134.241.58.253",0

Countless times if you prefer, but the idea is the same anyway  this song has been covered over and over by multiples artists from all around the world. As you suggested, adding one """"notable"""" example of each non-English language version of the song would be enough to show how famous/influential is the song. 
In a bit of hurry ? Not really. I simply wanted to clean this section up to reduce its length, nothing else. So I chose removing artists without a Wikipedia article. On the other hand, I don't think adding extra  tags would be appropriate as there's already a """"Refimprove"""" tag at the top of the section since July 2013. The best thing to do is to add sources (as reliable as possible). If you can do so then go ahead. I can help you as far as I can but I'm not sure it would be possible to find a source for each artist.   """,0

"Having looked more closely at the initial references you linked me to (before even glancing at the latest ones) I now realize that they are multiple and all say the same thing, so I've redacted what I had originally said about it possibly being a typo - one or two typos are possible, consistently being wrong multiple times is not.  All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13. 66.16.144.18",0
Hello Uketpat Thanks for the notification. I believe however that this article fulfils the criteria for inclusion on wikipedia. You are free to google search on the name of this notable personality who is a source of inspiration to many downtrodden young Africans. An extra-ordinary figure in the democratization of the continent and a major player in the worldwide democratization movement of the late 1980s. We have seen many stories about figures in the democratization struggle of Eastern Europe which are not as compelling as this celebrated in the global media. We read of the heros of Tianamen....this is one of the heroes of the Nigerian struggles that claimed more victims that Tianamen and was languishing in Jail at that same period. A second review will be much appreciated. i left you a message over 4weeks requesting a proof reading to be sure its ok to 'go life' but didn't get a response.,0

"""::::::I don't understand your reference. While I admit that I consider certain races """"inferior"""" (depending on how one defines the word """"inferior""""), I certainly have no desire to wipe anybody out. I don't recall ever saying that I did, and perhaps more to the point, it was never my intention to use Wikipedia as a soap box for my personal beliefs about race. I try to restrain myself from inserting personal bias when editing articles here, but it seems that editors with a far-left/Marxist/liberal/Jewish take on things make no effort to restrain themselves. Nor do they have to, since to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever been banned from Wikipedia for being a """"Marxist troll"""" or anything to that effect.

""":Clayc, that's not a list of evolutionary biologists who dispute evolution, nor of ones who dispute it for scientific (as opposed to religious) reasons; according to the website you provided, it's a list of """"Creationists holding DOCTORATES IN SCIENCE"""". Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren't banned from getting doctorates? That's rather silly indeed.
Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn't that you're trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too); rather, it's that you're trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think that the Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of """"science"""".
Also, that's an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. And how many people on that list are actually biologists?
Also, a """"criticisms"""" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it's finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered. It's not a scientific topic, however, but a social and historical one, so it will have little mention in the top-level article, Evolution. -

Let me refresh your memory.

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future.  """,0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

Now that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.

You are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.

Immediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.

Your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.

Interestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.

For example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.

You are wrong.

You also imply that I  am """"associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/"""".

Again, you are wrong. 

However, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am """"associated"""" with them, too?

As the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the """"summary"""" comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)

You say, """"just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading......."""".

I have not said """"this is all wrong and misleading"""". There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)

You ask me """"why did you use this disclaimer"""". 

I wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight """"sin"""" and """"pleasure"""" wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?  Much as in """"Reefer Madness""""?

The disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears.  Unlik",0

Sorry if I appeared not to discuss, but I thought I was following the instructions on how to merge. I put a brief explanation on the Boxer Rebellion Talk page, since there was no longer a Righteous Harmony Society Talk page to post on. My reason was that the RH article was a stub, had misleading information, was unsourced, and that it was part of the narrative of the BR article.

Hi, thanks for your work on Atkinson. Unfortunately the article had been riddled with vandalism the day before by a random IP.

 began calling me dark-skinned Indian followed by cursing everyone, and was edit-warring with everyone, and when BBBAAACCC got blocked, an IP (212.174.135.194) from Turkey (a country next to Greece) began revert-warring in order to keep BBBAAACCC's version of pages.
As noted by User:UzEE in the above 2007 report, (SMS) connects himself with Pakistan military. I've noticed that many banned socks have been behaving exactly like SMS and uploading copyrighted images (without permission) relating Pakistan's military, see . According to this recent revert by SMS, he exposed himself that he belongs to a special community within the Hindkowan group, they generally don't associate Pashtuns, and I notice this in SMS's actions. 
He often uses Islamabad IPs to edit, see , , and  and makes other edits by his other socks (User:TopGun  User:MHDH ) so nobody notices but I do because I get paid for doing this )
BBBAAACCC + SMS + TopGun + Ironboy11 + proxies + Islamabad IPs all relate to banned editor , this light-skinned Pakistani guy, the 'Grand Sockmaster' and mass copyright infringer. Clear Proof: 1 2, 3. He often appeared at Siddiqui article since December 2005, used to edit from USA but now from Islamabad. He has been insulting and attacking Indian editors since at least 2007 and has done his recent Indian attack under BBBAAACCC and proxy IPs.",0

dear Mr Manjunath, i was mearely trying to point out to Mr Pompus whoever he is, that other dravidian speakers, especially Kannada speakers have had their great empires too and that Tamils are not the only empire builders.

Precisely, you were trying to trumpet Kannada achievements at the cost of that article which had a totally different angle. Your modifications made the article completely absurd. Your narrow minded hatred against Tamils has only succeeded in vandalizing the article.

Secondly, Kannada speakers did not start their litreary traditions """"very late"""". they started their traditions """"later"""". please correct your english and see the difference in wording.

Thank you for the correction. Probably, that was the only change you had to make and you succeeded in totally distorting the article.

This was because they were ruled by prakrit speakers in the north and hence Kannnada did not get the official recognition as early as tamil. This again has to do with geographical proximity. Please be aware of this. Just because the satahahanas encouraged Prakrit does not mean Kannada speakers did not speak Kannada, they just had to abide by officialdom given to Prakrit thats all, just like tulu spearkers todays have to abide by Kannada being the official language.

Totally irrelevent to the topic at hand. Anyway, the studies on Dravidian languages is still ongoing process. If the present studies are correct, the regions of Andhra and Karnataka spoke Dravidian language earlier than the region of Tamil Nadu. Probably, that makes Proto-Kannada older than Proto-Tamil. But that does not deny the fact that South India was referred as Dravida and not Karnata. The article was a mere compliation of the records that talked about Dravida and its association with South India.

I dont see this issue out of place. Just as Mention of early tamils kingdoms is valid, so is the mention of Kannada kigndoms to show that speakers of other dravidian languages have had their time in the sun too. Get off your high Tamil horse.

This was the same reason I said you have not understood the content of the article. It was neither a propaganda to project Tamils nor to denigrate Kannadigas. It's just a mere exposition how Dravida represented whole of South (and that included Gujarat and Maharashtra where the only Dravidian influence was that of Kannada kingdoms in the later period).

I speak Kannada with my mother. Therefore, I consider myself a Kannadiga. Thanks for your personal attacks. Makes me proud of my Kannadaness.

As WP:OI says,
Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy.
The published information which is the basis for the annotation (i.e. the three letters/arrows) is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map  and also in a footnote to the map's caption  i.e.
Macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast, the location and circumstances of the accident, and the location of Gage's lodgings and Harlow's home and surgery..
Thoughts on this? As with the image links, I've put the map back so we (and others) can see what we're talking about.   

A9 Proving a negative
This regards a recent edit  to the passage 
Macmillan's comprehensive survey of accounts of Gage (scientific and popular) found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes...
which removed the word comprehensive.

This is a delicate point and I want to come up with something everyone can live with. I think there are two questions here.

First, Was Macmillan's analysis indeed comprehensive? No one who's been participating have any doubt on that, but just in case, open the collapse list.

""""first rate example of carefully done historical work"""" (Psychological Reports, 2001)
""""obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered (Cortex, 2004)
""""fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend"""" (Lancet, 2001)
""""Even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information..."""" (Neurosurgery Quarterly, 2002)
""""The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""" (Science, 2000)
""""Macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding Gage is concerned this must be a definitive work.  (History of the Human Sciences, 2007)
""""Macmillan has shown that the record of how Phineas Gage’s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution..."""" (New England Journal of Medicine"""", 2004)

Second, Do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? IMO I think we do, because it the analysis assserts a negative, which requires extraordinary research; just saying Macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. (Two examples from the collapse box: """"Macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered""""; """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""")Without such a clear statement, we get edit summaries such as this one: .

Actually, there's a third question: Do we need to include a quotation (such as the """"further research is not necessary""""  above) supporting the comprehensiveness? I don't think the reader needs that. I had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness  in other words, the quotation was there for editors, not readers, and this discussion can take its place.

So what I suggest is that the article say Macmillan's comprehensive analysis of accounts of Gage...'', where [97][98][99] cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness, but without quoting them. What do you think?

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

 Song move 

You gave me some good advice about moving and redirecting pages. Thank you.

Unfortunately, I made a real mess when I tried to move """"Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""""  When I did the redirect, I accidentally mistyped the title as """"Let It Snow! Let It Snoe! Let It Snow!"""" (notice the """"Snoe"""") and forgot to look before I leapt. If that wasn't bad enough, I then went to the Redirect page for """"Let It Snow"""" and, instead of leaving the misspelling alone, I changed it to redirect to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"""" (the correct spelling), thus creating that page, which did not previously exist. Thus, when I tried to change the misspelled name to the correct name, I of course got the error that the other page already exists.  

Not to mention that there were some double redirects when I looked in """"What links here,"""" which I was going to start to fix until I realized how badly I messed up the original move. (It turns out that someone had renamed the page in 2005, with no discussion, from """"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow,"""" a move I would have vehemently protested if I'd been hanging around here at the time.) 

I need some help to undo this. The simplest thing would be to delete the current """"redirect"""" page for the correct title and resume from there, renaming my misspelled page and then looking at the redirects again, but I can't delete pages, and I know the rules about cutting and pasting.  """,0

The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity.

As Bernard Guinot writes in the abstract of his paper, """"The International Conference held in 1884 at Washington defined a universal time as the mean solar time at the Greenwich meridian (GMT). Now, the Universal Time, version UT1, is strictly defined as proportional to the angle of rotation of the Earth in space. In this evolution, the departure of UT1 from GMT does not exceed one or two seconds."""" Clearly there cannot be a departure between two time scales if they are defined to be the the same.   """,0

 Drug abuse 

""""Before I attempt to do a major revision on this article, I would like to get your opinion on the title. I notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction, so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article? It seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse, and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction. What do you think? If you disagree, in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go, and what topics do you think it should focus upon? I was thinking it could examine the scientific, poltical, and social aspects."""" -Viriditas

I believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article (which is a redirection to recreational drug use).  It could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted NPOV term, and having appropriate redirects.

I agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article, but then such an article (substance abuse) should also include information on alcohol abuse, which currently has its own page as alcoholism.

The drug addiction page has some POV problems.  What should be done here is to leave 'drug addiction' itself under the domain of Addiction, and rename the drug addiction page (with all its references to brain chemistry, and method of action) to Drug dependence.  Anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page.

I'm more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper NPOV naming (even if they are stub articles) as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages.

My vote would be to make substance abuse it's own page talking about substance abuse in general, and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances (i.e. alcoholism).  Specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages.  I'm certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages.

I'm certain that some will be opposed to separating the """"good and the bad"""" of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages (consider Alcohol > Alcoholic beverage > Alcoholism), but if alcohol is treated that way, then other substances deserve the same consideration.

If people disagree, then I'd argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined.   23:23, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)""",0

It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

Not when the Army that beat it went on to become the Indian Army.You can say it predated it , but it was not a predecessor to the Indian Army.",0

 Anti-Love Song 

I moved your information from the talk page to the main article. It looks shorter now, but I kept everything. The main reason it is shorter is because phrases like """"from Raven-Symone's fourth album, Raven-Symone"""" just become """"from the album"""".

This is the right way to handle singles that never charted. They don't get an individual article, but there's nothing at all wrong  with putting the infobox and description in the album article.

We haven't been working well together, but I'd like to try and change that. I can see that you are an editor that wants to do things right. Unfortunately, part of doing things right is to not create articles that fail guidelines. The guidelines for article creation on singles are at WP:NSONGS, which I kept pointing at every time I redirected one of these articles or nominated it for deletion. Following guidelines is important, and, if you do so, we should get along much better.— """,0

"""CCD affecting other insects?==
While all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  

At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. 

I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. 
Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  
I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  
""""Little if anything""""? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a """"disease"""", diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT """"stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder"""" - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?
While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.

"Personal Experience 

Since there isn't much to this article (or stub), I thought I would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut. I use it occasionally for insomnia. In my opinion, it is not a long term solution for insomnia. Tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use. I have never had a problem with withdrawal, but I have heard that is possible, but not life threatening, just uncomfortable.

Phenibut does has a long half-life so usage should be spaced out. I would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions, then a minimum of two days off. One use a week would be preferable.

It does work well for insomnia, and tends to produce vivid dreams, which is interesting, but its usage should be carefully monitored.

When used as directed, I have heard of no major side effects. It will increase the potency of sedatives, so that must be kept in mind.

This is just my own personal experience, hopefully more people will add to the discussion.",0

I and I alone provided for mankind the most powerful machine since the dawn of time. I was foolish to think I'd get a meeting with the president or the Nobel peace prize. I guess I had my little finger cocked the wrong political way when I did it. Since this was known the forces that be have turned their evil cannons of jealousy toward me and ignored every rule in the book, played every unfair card in the book known and made as many unfair ones they could get their hands on to destroy me and steal it and gain credit for themselves on it. You have to decide if you are on the side of truth and life that I intended for this technology to bring or allow those lord high felons to destroy me with unfair and unequally applied rules. Are you going to be a part of that? Why do I say this? Because if I don't stand no honest person will forever thereafter. Have Wikipedia editors blocked William R. Buckley for the admitted first attack here and thereafter continual attacks, one short one and he's back at it,... or blocked SteveBaker for vandalism at all as he continues to do now and do as much damage to me he can? No. Or punished those dealing out blocks to me when they knew I did nothing for political bias? Did Wikipedia give me credit for my work and ban the copyright infringer and ultimate dark and threatening talker Freitas and Merkle  from this place NO! 

Wikipedia's rules clearly allow the publishing of lies from longer standing people of note, no mater how nefariously they slam the up and coming and tell lies far and wide and Wikipedia knowingly lets them. This is a media rag, period. Like any other. There are no real rules when they apply differently to one than another. Further, again, if you are being destroyed by unfair rules you have a Boston Tea party. Get it? It's called """"self defense"""" something you clearly do not understand. The only rule is a fair one and I don't see you or any other here trying to keep them fair in any way form of fashion you are just blowing political smoke. If you did we would not be here. I have not once been treated fairly and I don't see you doing it or anyone here that bothers to hang around here. You speak of rules, then block those that wrongly attacked me first before I even had a chance to play fair. Before I stuck my head out of the womb as a newbie around here. Don't walk away when I am being punished wrongly and you know it and above all don't drag my good name through the mud like a pig would do Mr. media guy. If you treat me fairly, you would be the first, from Larry King to Don and Mike to the Chief of police in Prince William County Virginia who had me arrested five times knowing I was innocent saying I was crazy for just talking about a self-replicator, even with my patent in my hand, gold seal and all (and you won't write of that here, not fairly). You want fair rules start making and enforcing them fairly and changing the unfair ones here starting here and now (but you wont). But most of all punish those who start the transgressions, not those fighting to defend themselves from the initial onslaught. And do not tell me you do not have special preferences around here.

I have contacted every lawyer on the list at the patent office and they will not sue a university professor (to answer you that question). Do me a fair article and you will never hear from me again because I am only here to fight a bad bio attack on me, that is all. I don't like Wikipedia because the rules are unfair here,woirse than any other media operation I've known.

Please note that I never called him or any other editor a """"liar"""" ever. Before the last ANI I had commented about Wee's clear misrepresentation of facts as """"lies"""" about 4 times, these are all presented at that ANI. After that I toned it down to """"misrepresent of facts/comments"""" or """"untrue statements"""" simply because there is no other way of calling it. Have you looked at the diffs presented in that ANI by Wee and me? Can you point to any specific one where I have failed to present evidence (or the evidence presented was insufficient) as to back my claims of him misrepresenting my comments? As I've said, other editors agreed that if an editor makes it a habit to engage in such disruptive behaviour it is not a personal attack to mention it. How would you react to an editor purposely and repeatedly misrepresenting your comments in a discussion? Do you not agree that such behaviour should be brought to the attention of that editor?
It would appear as if you looked at the former ANI and took Wee's word for granted about me """"casually calling him a liar"""".

Hi, I'm not sure if anyone is watching this page but I wanted to introduce myself here as a representative on Wikipedia for the Motion Picture Association of America. I work for the MPAA, and my colleagues and I have noticed that this article is in bad shape. We would like to assist volunteer editors in making this a better article, both under Wikipedia's guidelines and as an informative page about MPAA. For example, I think it's important to replace the """"History"""" text which borrows (sometimes word for word) from the  MPAA website. With help from someone knowledgeable about Wikipedia, I'm working on a better version of this section and I'll hopefully be able to share that here soon. For questions or thoughts about this page, you can reply here or on my user talk page.   """,0

A quick word on the matter: there is no possible situation under which calling another editor a liar is remotely acceptable.

"Examples
Someone who has not seen this 'alphabet' used in practise before could conclude from the table and the examples provided that it is a more or less fixed transliteration system for Modern Standard Arabic. In reality, however, it is almost always used to transliterate spoken Arabic, i.e. dialects, and there is an enormous amount of variation. For example, contrary to what the table suggests, both س and ص are usually represented by 's'; the distinction by using a capital 'S' for ص looks very neat, but I have never seen it in use. I would therefore suggest to provide more realistic examples, such as: (Lebanese) kif/keef sa7tak, chou/shu 3am ta3mil? weyn baddak nitghada? etc. Maybe it should also be noted that - in parallel with Arabic writing - there is a tendency to omit vowels.79.219.118.88",0

Perseus missile - Description or Characteristics?
Your lack of English comprehension is appalling. Your edit summary reads, """"the section here describes the missile, not just lists its characteristics. Standard way of naming sections on similar articles. Also, i would be happy to compare GRE scores"""". You are making this oh so easy for me, but for your benefit I will simplify things by hypothetically replacing the missile with a person. If I were to describe a person - perhaps on a police report - what would it entail? Height, weight, hair and eye colour, age? Yes, but I may also go on to describe the persons observable behavior, actions and tone of voice etc, to the best of my ability. This is a fairly standard example of what would fit a description. 

The articles original sub heading - Characteristics - encompasses a more diverse and flexible approach to the subject, for example distinctive features or a distinguishing quality unique to that particular missile (or person!). It goes more in-depth, a wider representation of the subject. However, as defining Characteristics are very descriptive in nature, it is easy and common these days to make mistakes, just as you have clearly made the mistake of getting muddled with the correct use of description and characteristics (as represent by your edit summary).

Difference between a description and a characteristic?
Description: He is tall, 6ft 6.
Characteristic: It is his height of 6ft 6 that distinguishes him.

  Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, Englisc by its speakers) is an early form of the English language that was spoken and written in parts of what are now  England and southern Scotland between the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century.
 

  Middle English is the name given by linguistics to the diverse forms of the English language spoken between the Norman invasion of 1066 and the mid-to-late 15th century.
 

  Early Modern English is the stage of the English language used from about the end of the Middle English period (the latter half of the 15th century) to 1650.
 

Being that this is my specialist (degree) subject and I am one of the few people who are actually able to read and speak Englisc (along with the old Frisian and Norse dialects which contributed to it), you are more than welcome to take me on about the reliability of those sources; but I don't fancy your chances )   09:15",0

"Hi Proudbolsahye. Sorry for the delay in reply. No problem about Patton, it happens. ) In regards to Maghakian's infobox, the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person, containing only key information succinctly. The ribbon icons, in my opinion, detract from the information, serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be. I know you pointed out the case of the John Shalikashvili article, but I think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out, which should not have to be the case: it should be presented just there. The article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed, as you have done in Maghakian, but not too much information placed in the infobox. As for the service medals, as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received, and not service medals. Maghakian is notable for his awards of the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart (the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox). If he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did, then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here. I think you would be better off expanding the awards section of the article and keeping the infobox succinct. Cheers,",0

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.

You said: Except when you violate the rules about creating articles, in which case the page in violation will be quickly deleted, leaving no trace of what occurred. Even the conversation about it may be deleted forever. This comment, like everything else on this page, does not cite sources. This comment may also be in violation of some rule.

That's an interesting point. Several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already. Will you be helping out with that?   

> Hi Kim.  I don't know what """"looking into"""" even means, in regards to Wikipedia. I don't know who people are, who does what, or who created the rules.  I don't know what """"helping out"""" means, in regards to your question.

My first effort here, at creating an entry, was put up for deletion in 4 minutes, then deleted without discussion by some admin.  Now I can't find the brief discussion about that. 

But it led to the realization that many many pages here, the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia, don't cite sources.  The pages don't list authors either.  They are nebulous pages, that don't follow the rules those pages insist I follow.

Interesting?  Damn right it is interesting.  I've read a lot of criticism of wiki, and defended wikipedia for years.  But now, well, I see a huge flaw in the system.

 Is user:Nakon some kind of Bot? 

I have no idea what happens on Wikipedia sometimes.  While reading the ALS entry, due to a friend having been diagnosed with it, I followed a link to the ALS Association, which gave me that page that says there is no article.  I looked it up on Google, and created a short starter page on it.  

Right after I hit create, I realized there was already an entry, but it was under ALS Association, so I hit edit this page, to make it a redirect. It came up as deleted!  In a matter of seconds, some asswipe called Nakon had deleted the page.

I fear people not finding an institution on this list could be misinterpretted to mean that it might be accredited. Which could cause real harm.
The length of this list doesn't carry the same negatives IMHO as the examples of lists given by ElKevbo.
An institution without an article might flush out academic frauds POVing at Wikipedia at least as well as institutions with articles.

Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release, and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a """"civil rights"""" organization whose primary purpose is fighting """"bigotry"""", when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly, they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion, and their leader William Donohue, who is for all practical purposes their only member, has made numerous anti-Jewish statements. It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church, when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New York's headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies.

The NPOV and anti-libel policy on Wikipedia has become an """"accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and don't criticize anyone on relevant grounds"""" policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles. If someone who was not a fifteen-year-old anime-watching idiot could actually become an administrator around here, maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics. Instead, we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles, while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of """"offending"""" people who don't like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law.

Vertebrobasilar Stroke Study Findings
There was an association between chiropractic services and subsequent vertebrobasilar artery stroke in persons under 45 years of age, but a similar association was also observed among patients receiving general practitioner services. This is likely explained by patients with vertebrobasilar artery dissection-related neck pain or headache seeking care before having their stroke.

Hence, there is no difference in association between stroke and DC and MD visits.  This suggests that VB strokes are not necessarily caused by SMT or a visit to the DC but that they are already in progress prior to the visit.  It should also be noted that there are 2 MDs involved in this study in case the argument of bias comes up.  It will be interesting what CynRN and the stroke fear mongers have to say now that the evidence disputes their beliefs.",0

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

 Second try

As stated the first time,  """"no (editing) of an article related to anything political in Vaughan, no AfDs, RfDs, Deletion Reviews, talk page editing and vandalism, endless article edits and reverts"""" are to be allowed.

There are no exceptions. Anything that you are involved in on Wikipedia that has to do with something or someone in Vaughan should stop totally. That includes the RfD. That doesn't mean you have to remove it, but just leave it alone. Trust the admins. 

Leotardo, I thank you for agreeing with this proposal in principle. I'm glad you are willing to participate in the process. I agree with your ends. So to Pm_shef: you must agree to concede the two concerns Leotardo has, in the spirit of co-operation.

Pm_shef mentioned the Susan Kadis article that he wanted to research for; but though the 10 hour time expired, there are still no such edits. I'm sure it doesn't mean that he isn't taking this process seriously. 

So Pm_shef and Leotardo, and myself, we have 10 hours before all the editing noted above will totally cease. Pm_shef is to add his objective Kadis research, and Leotardo will have his two edits added, before the 10 hours expires. I will go and do that now.

The section appears to comply with WP:BLP as it lists mainstream media coverage of the accusation and denial, rather than the unconfirmed claim itself. Further reverts may result in a block.

Please improve the article by negotiating NPOV wording in the Talk section rather than by serial reverting.  If  the material violates WP:BLP or is libelous, so that the #RR does not apply, then reverts made to enforce this provision are generally not considered contentious. However, it can be easy to confuse removing potentially libellous material with an edit war over neutrality issues, which are contentious edits. Err on the side of caution: do not repeatedly remove material you consider defamatory unless it is blatant, and seek intervention from others early at Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard.:

On the 1963 results I am slightly suspicious of Laver winning twice by the same score 6-0, 6-3 at MSG; once in the 6 man phase and once in the final play-off phase.

"Very Important discussion.I would like to submit that
1.It was not founded by Imam Ahmed Rida Khan Quadri.He never founded a so called Barelvi movement.He was a one of the great Scholar of Sunni Sufi movement in South Asia.His opponents gave this title Barelvi.It was never used by him.He never said that this is Barelvi movement.He always considered his organizations and Institutions as part of Ahle Sunnah movement.Even today all organisations and associations subscribing to traditional ideology of Ahle Sunnah Wala Jamaah in South Asia just uses title of Sunni.In reality and on ground Barelvi word is not used by Supporters of Ahmed Rida.His opponents used it to fulfill their agenda that it is a new movement.
2.This seems to be doubtful.It has been contested here by Shabiha, you should try to support your view from more verifiable sources.The movement was not Madarsa based and this is just an allegation with out much explanation.

"""::::No, the Schofield text rarely makes claims of the """"first"""" sort. That is one of its major problems, actually. It doesn't effectively place Priestley in his historical milieu.

I would not rely on the JP: A Comet in the System book. It is not the most reliable text we have (see publication information) and citing a dissertation is, sad to say, not the first line of defense. I already listed that Schofield quote above, which shows Priestley's indebtedness to other eighteenth-century thinkers. That list is more reliable, in my opinion.

 Coup not Revolution 

First off, I removed the reference to """"after Yanukovich fled the country"""".  The term """"fled"""" is loaded and POV.  To say he """"left"""" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let's talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:

Revolution:  """"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.""""

Coup:  """"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.""""

Let me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.

There was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""... but the term """"Ukrainian Revolution"""" is both POV and misleading.

Note:  Above I use the literal definition of 'Revolution' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of 'wide-ranging change' (e.g. the 'industrial revolution').

  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the """"Velvet Revolution"""" nor the """"Orange Revolution"""" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.  I reiterate that the appropriate title is """"Maidan Coup"""" or """"2014 Ukrainian Coup""""  173.79.251.253  """,0

My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances?   
My perspective on Wikipedia is much different now. I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there. (I have made close to 9,000 edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors.) I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while. Also, my misery was generated by a small group of editors. I am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an Arcom settlement.   — (Talk)

 Possible issue 
One weird question. The old rumor about the last line of EoE came out as true, and in a rather disturbing interview. The line was supposed to be """"I'd never want to be killed by you of all men, absolutely not!"""" but was changed to """"Disgusting"""" after a question from Anno. The situation as commented by Miyamura (voice of Asuka) is: 
At last Anno asked me, """"Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?"""" I had been thinking he was a strange man, but at that moment I felt disgusting. So I told him that I thought """"Disgusting"""". And then he sighed and said """"... thought as much."""" He said. """" I thought as much. Original text mirror, archived 
Now here's the situation. This actually is a very simple analysis - one which I am sure even Wikipedia would allow, but it is of a bit questionable nature. In End of Evangelion, Shinji sees Asuka in the hospital, ends up revealing her body and masturbates to her. Asuka who returns after the Third Impact (questionable prior death notwithstanding) makes the comment """"Disgusting"""" when she is laying beside Shinji. Would simply stating the information as presented be acceptable for the meaning of Asuka's final line, the meaning is so obvious that it is not a synth.   """,0

 Didier Mbenga 

Didier Mbenga was indeed born in RD Congo. But he holds the Belgian nationality. He even plays for the Belgian national team. So I don't see why he has been stated as a Congolese.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 81.165.108.11   """,0
"""This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes """"But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create."""" Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only """"some few things!""""  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want """" society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.""""  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that """"only psychologists know psychology"""" as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It's as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects """"encyclopedic."""" A """"democratic sense of equality"""" brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (""""why shouldn't everybody be able to practice medicine? let's leak all the questions ans answers...""""), etc.  

When you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it's much harder for this to be done if he can't use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas' statement that """"is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful"""" is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach's main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests' """"cheat sheet"""" (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test's questions and answers.      

So no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They're just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It's rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.

Some people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the """"dark ages"""" by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when """"common sense"""" indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but """"common sense"""" tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of """"magic"""" is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).",0

If not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to Hinduism as a religion of non-violence? The article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to Hinduism. Isn't that a sufficient ground to shed light on the religion's actual position. Besides, the animal killings of the festival are associated to Hinduism but based on what? Isn't that an original research or a subject of personal opinion too? Thank you I await your reply.  (Talk?)

It is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks, though there are some who disagree with that. If when you remove a personal attack you are reverted, then do not remove it again. Instead seek an outside party to investigate, preferably on some sort of public noticeboard. I really do not know the first thing about the Ireland dispute and from what little I have heard I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot poll.

No, there are not different standards for different editors. There is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system, and those who do not grasp the intricate details. While Wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. Knowing the correct """"form"""", noticeboard or procedure will take you far, knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther. It is a bit of a shame that such an advantage is given to those who know the ins and outs but it is the way things end up working here. Chillum 01:01, 14""",0

In my case you attacked a non-controversial contribution to an article because of references.  Not because you disagreed with it, or even understood it.  Just because of the legalistic issue of references.  And the article does actually read a bit like a company sales promotion, but you would not have noticed that more serious issue.

Well, I'll tell you a dirty little secret about Wikipedia.  Lots of good contributions do not have references.  Particularly about maths, science and technology.  But just because some well meaning editor does not go to the extra effort cite does not make it original research.  If there is controversy, then certainly references are essential, and need to be good ones.  But most of the world is not controversial.

I am proposing the following sentences: """"A study throughout the entire United States has reported that around 48 percent of people who graduated high school in 1979 have used Cocaine recreationally during some point in their lifetime, compared to approximately 20 percent of students who graduated between the years of 1980 and 1995.""""

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge.""",0

 Cluttering royalty articles

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year.

Dear, this is my new submission of CEFC

 China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC) 
      
China Energy Fund Committee (CEFC) is a non-governmental, non-profit civil society organization. The Committee is an NGO with Special Consultative Status, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (UN ECOSOC). Registered in Hong Kong, the Committee obtains tax exemption under Section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance as a charitable organization. Also registered in Virginia, the United States, the Committee obtains tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as a public charity.     ↓",0
"It was still NEVER stated that the two pieces of the Bo that appeared when Lily called on her weapon were intended to be Tonfa.  Yes, we saw that they were the same design of Theo's Tonfa, but they were never said to be Tonfa, nor were we led believe that Lily would ever use them as Tonfa.  Again, as far as we saw from the first episode, they are ONLY intended to be combined into the Bo, therefore stating that they are also Tonfa would be speculation.  I have started a formal discussion of this on the Jungle Fury article's discussion page.  If you have any concerns, address them there so everyone can see and offer their own opinions should they have any.",0

Support.  Conjuring is objectively a conceit, an open pretence that Magic (paranormal) is in use.  Magic (paranormal) is the originating concept in this sense.

But Google Translate, like many translating machines, is not very reliable. The name of this lake in Chinese is """"太湖"""", romanised, without spacing, to """"Taihu"""". The second character (湖 hu) means """"lake"""". The current title (Taihu Lake) as it stands is a pleonasm; it essentially is """"Tai Lake Lake"""". this is similar for the mountain ranges. Huangshan (黄山), not Huangshan Mountains, as that is again a pleonasm; the second character here (山 shan) means """"mountain"""". So don't listen to the IP above.

I called your comments snide (which was not a personal attack) and I was merely pointing out the obvious nature of your edit summary. If you're going to throw policy links at me and get all wikilawyerish then I am going to do the same. I will also point out the obvious hypocrisy behind your chastising my edit summary when yours was the one that was uncalled for. So next time think twice about treating an edit summary like a talk page because there is a difference between the two. You might want to try reading Help:Edit summary and Wikipedia:Talk page to learn what the difference is. Thank you and have a nice day.,0

"Notability of Dem 704 Boyz
A tag has been placed on Dem 704 Boyz, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add  on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.",0
